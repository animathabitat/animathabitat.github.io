        <p>Between the mid-1800s and the early 1900s, the annexation, colonization and partition of most of Africa by seven Western European nation-states &ndash; the Belgian, the British, the French, the German, the Italian, the Portuguese and the Spanish colonies &ndash; charted an unprecedented &lsquo;scramble&rsquo; for land and natural resources. The ivory trade followed the slave trade routes out of Africa, with broken tusks carried on the shoulders of <i>broken</i> men, out of the forests and savannas <i>en route</i> to the seas. African forest and savanna elephants were razed to the ground. Elephant populations were felled to ten million by the early 1900s, as an &lsquo;ivory frenzy&rsquo; in Europe was fueled by the mass production of combs, brush handles, piano keys and billiard balls and so on.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Christy, 2012">1</a>,&nbsp;<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Hartley, 2013">2</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>Elephants continued to be massacred into the 1950s, with influxes of trafficked ivory that corresponded to African regions gaining independence from colonial rule. This meant wars. And elephants were a casualty.</i></p>

        <p>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was agreed to by the Parties &ndash; the nation-states that signed the Convention &ndash; in March 1973. The Parties to CITES listed the African elephant on Appendix III in 1976, then Appendix II in 1977, then as threatened with extinction, again, in 1978, yet, with a clause that permitted commercial international trade in ivory under the regulation of CITES. Over the years, more and more States joined this treaty organization that would ordain international wildlife trade policy. CITES as a result regulated the continued commercial international trade in ivory.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_1970();" title="CITES">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) revealed groundbreaking undercover footage of criminal syndicates caught red-handed, exposing how the international trade in ivory operated.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_1980();" title="EIA, 1989">6</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">Ten years after commercial international trade in ivory was regulated under CITES, African elephant populations had, again, declined by more than half. Six hundred thousand remained by 1989. In July of that year, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) set fire to a 12-ton ivory stockpile in Nairobi National Park as a public, symbolic statement against the ivory trade. In October, in Lausanne, Switzerland, at the seventh Conference of the Parties, the Parties to CITES listed the African elephant on Appendix I, as a result a ban on the commercial international trade in ivory went into effect in early 1990.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Christy, 2012; Hartley, 2013; CITES">1-3</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">At the time of the ivory ban, the United States of America, Europe and Japan collectively consumed eighty per cent of the &lsquo;carved trinket&rsquo; ivory market.

According to Mugabe, elephants would have to pay for their habitat with their ivory. There was an alternative proposal: Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe would continue to honor the ivory ban granted an exception be made for an experimental sale of ivory stockpiles&mdash;ivory from elephants that had been culled or had died of natural causes.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Christy, 2012">1</a>,&nbsp;<a class="button" onclick="fn_1970();" title="CITES">3</a>,&nbsp;<a class="button" onclick="fn_1990();" title="CITES, 2002">10</a>]</sup></p>

There was, again, an alternative: South Africa plus the Republic of Botswana, the Republic of Namibia and the Republic of Zimbabwe submitted a proposal for another sale of ivory stockpiles.

        <p>The price of ivory reached US$1,000 per pound in Beijing, as a consumer class emerged in the People's Republic of China. Ignited by increased demand in Asia, stoked by limited wages in Africa, the number of elephants killed for their tusks and the large-scale seizures of ivory elevated so high that 2011 was labeled &lsquo;annus horribilis&rsquo; for the species.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_2011();" title="TRAFFIC, 2011">17</a>]</sup></p>

Since no inventory was made of global ivory stockpiles before the ban, and since ivory can weather time, for all intents and purposes, forever, any trader caught with ivory tusks brazenly invoked the timeless defense: this is &lsquo;pre-ban&rsquo; ivory.</i></p>

          <div>
            <p>In the approval process for the Parties to CITES, TRAFFIC overstated that its ETIS database extended back to the 1989 ivory ban, when, in fact, States were not asked to report ivory seizures to its system until 1998. And so when a second ivory stockpile sale was proposed to the Parties to CITES, in 2002, the ETIS database had no effective baseline to evaluate the Japan experiment. Even with another decade, the transparency of the ETIS database was limited by its core metric: seizures. Export or import seizures were, of course, managed and operated by the authorities of each State, itself, under evaluation.</p>

            <!-- &mdash;the first ivory stockpile sale under CITES -->

            <p class="linebreak">The People's Republic of China considered the TRAFFIC information system a failure in regard to trade in ivory, at first. Then, after Japan received its first ivory stockpile under CITES, China reported the number of seizures of ivory trafficked into the Chinese mainland went up. In 2002, a Chinese report warned the Parties to CITES that a main reason for the increased trafficking of illicit ivory into Asia was the Japan experiment: &ldquo;Chinese people misunderstand the decision and believe that the international trade in ivory has been resumed.&rdquo; The Chinese consumers were apparently under the impression that the ivory markets were legal again, and, by 2004, the Chinese government had apparently forsaken any concerns. The People’s Republic of China petitioned the Parties to CITES for a second ivory stockpile sale.</p>

            <!-- CITES ignored China’s warning and placed its faith entirely in the ETIS statistics. “The data we have from ETIS is that there is no correlation between decisions made at CITES and the illegal trade,” Willem Wijnstekers, CITES secretary-general, would later assert in anticipation of more CITES-approved ivory sales. Tom Milliken, director of ETIS, would likewise suggest that the Japan sale had worked: “It is encouraging to note that the illicit trade in ivory progressively declined over the next five years.” But Milliken didn’t know what the illicit trade had done; what he knew was his seizure statistics. Nevertheless a judgment was made, and the future of the African elephant may forever be clouded by the moment when CITES, lacking the data to evaluate the impact of its first ivory sale, endorsed a second. -->

            <p class="linebreak">The Parties to CITES had not been informed of the extent of the illicit ivory trade. The Parties had the ETIS seizure statistics. <i>And so the future of the African elephant may forever be clouded by the moment when the Parties to CITES, lacking the data to evaluate the impact of its first ivory stockpile sale, endorsed a second.</i></p>

            <p class="linebreak">Japan is an island nation with a narrow primary use for its ivory: carved stamps called hanko. The People's Republic of China is a nation with a population of more than ten times the size, a separate system for the main ivory market&mdash;the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), an extensive investment in Africa, and a culture with many uses for ivory ranging from symbolic figures to touristic trinkets.</p>

            <!-- And the Chinese government, which controls who may sell ivory in China, was not undercutting the black market, it was using its monopoly power to outperform the black market. -->

            <p class="linebreak">Once the Chinese government legally acquired an ivory stockpile, the commercialized, criminalized &lsquo;legal&rsquo; ivory loophole began in earnest. As part of the proposed ivory stockpile sale to China, a number of measures were instituted to safeguard the government-registered ivory, notably a photo-identification system for any ivory carving larger than a trinket. A 2011 survey of ivory markets in China, as reported by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in 2012, found that ivory markets in China found a way to exploit the system. On a small identification card &ndash; in a smaller-still photograph &ndash; the ivory carvings of the same religious or traditional motif all look alike. The exploitative markets simply retain the identification card from a sale, reuse the photograph to launder a look-alike carving made from illicit ivory, and then repeat the process and so on. And so, the cards now have value and a secondary illicit market. This identification system, which was proposed as a measure of legitimacy, has proved worse than no system at all.</p>

        <p>According to a report published by Save The Elephants on ivory sales and stockpiles in Hong Kong, more than 100 tons of ivory from the Hong Kong government-registered non-commercial ivory stockpile were &lsquo;deactivated&rsquo; and disappeared in a particularly short span, from 2008 through 2010, in particular in 2009, when a change in the registration system in Hong Kong required a license to possess ivory for commercial purpose. The report showed a correlation between the decreased weight of the government-registered non-commercial stockpile with the increased number of mainland Chinese tourists to Hong Kong. The report noted that correlation, however, in contrast with government-registered commercial ivory sales from 2010 through 2013, which accounted for less than 5 tons.

        <h3 class="linebreak">Elephant Conservation Today</h3>
        <p>The demand for ivory, the trafficking and the poaching are an acute threat to elephants in the wild in Africa today. Yet the ivory trade is not the only threat. There are ever more challenges for elephants with electrified fences, prolonged droughts and human-wildlife conflicts over any natural resources that remain in the buffer zones and on the fringes of farmlands developed into once wild elephant habitat. An elephant needs its tusks. And a lot of space. <i>Elephant conservation is kind of like a big deal.</i></p>

        <p class="linebreak">As for a proposition to take on the commercial international trade in ivory &ndash; the governmental manipulations of ivory stockpiles and the cultural fixations on ivory carvings &ndash; that is a dual challenge. A solution highlighted in this history of elephant conservation has started with investigative journalism. Undercover footage of criminal syndicates exposed how the international trade in ivory operated in the 1980s, leaked documents reported on the mismanagement of the Chinese government-registered ivory stockpile in the 1990s, into the 2000s, and then journalists, often posed as tourists, shined a light on dark ivory markets within the Chinese government-regulated system that followed the second one-off sale of ivory, and that same system persist to this day.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">In this history of elephant conservation, there has also surfaced a subtext of investment in people. People, and African people most of all, have the most meaningful part to play in any solution for African elephant conservation. And so, a theme here has been investment in the livelihoods of people living in rural areas of elephant range States in Africa, including access to education and health care and so on. This part of any solution extends to many of the other challenges that threaten elephants today and, increasingly, into the future. Furthermore, this theme of investment in people has extended to educational campaigns in ivory-consuming States in Asia, in particular, to stop the demand for ivory.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>A plea to save the elephants.</i> At times, ivory burns have attracted worldwide attention and have proved a critical, visual tool to address the poaching crisis. Sometimes public figures in ivory-consuming States then raised the level of awareness about this crisis, and invited political leaders to take on this central proposition that is rooted in scientific evidence and facts about the trade in ivory. And everytime any person in a position to purchase ivory, now, or in the future, becomes informed about the implication of ivory products &ndash; and the life of the elephants &ndash; the more the buying stops, the killing will too. A last hope in this battle for the elephants is that more and more people like you will become invested in future campaigns or funds to save them.</p>

        <!-- When the buying stops, the killing can too. -->
