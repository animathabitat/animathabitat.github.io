        <h5 class="author">Press secretary at Animat Habitat.</h5>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>The big picture behind the paintings&mdash;where this medium of painting can still overshadow that of photography, in a textural, visual language of layered brush marks, there is fashioned an aesthetic foundation for artistic interpretation of the world. As such, a Naturalist painting does not just show another moose or yellow-bellied sapsucker&hellip; Another pair of apes or tigers&hellip; Another whale&hellip; A Naturalist painting, while grounded in the beauty of the natural world, serves to make a statement about nature. There is a raison d'être&mdash;a reason for why the painting was worth making&mdash;worth the time obliged to put paint on canvas and into perspective and all that. And still, there rests a sense of environment or setting or space. A forest, for example, with old pines and the cold breaths billowed between the trees.</i></p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">Impressionism</h3>
        <p>Modern art history holds many contextual pathways into the world of painting. Nineteenth century Paris-based Impressionism. Later Post-Impressionism. Soviet-era Constructivism. Mid-twentieth century New York City-based Abstract Expressionism. And time and again Realism, which originated as an art movement in mid-nineteenth century Paris, moved into nature with plein air painters inspired to paint the natural world, then into its modern legacy, in part pioneered by Canadian artist Robert &lsquo;Bob&rsquo; Bateman, so-named Naturalism. Bob is noted as one of the first to paint realistic wildlife set within a natural context, with unromanticized natural behaviour. Many of his paintings epitomize the Naturalist art style. Many of the compositions for those paintings, however, were first informed by a history of abstract art.</p>

        <p>A Naturalist painting represents a moment in nature as captured on canvas. That moment in a Bateman painting is, as William Whitehead narrates in the 1978 National Film Board of Canada mini-documentary film about the Canadian artist: <i>Images of the Wild</i>, &ldquo;a moment that could have happened but did not.&rdquo;<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Lightfoot, 1978.">1</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>Roger Tory Peterson, renowned Naturalist illustrator and author of a number of field guides to birds, has eloquently elucidated the effect of a painting by Robert Bateman as compared with a painting by Andrew Wyeth, another Realist painter with a different, Regionalist style:</p>

        <div>
          <p><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>Wyeth nostalgically freezes the moment, holds on to it[.] It is a moment suspended forever. In contrast, Bateman's subjects are ready to go somewhere else, to fly away. His creatures are inevitably off-centred. They enter from off the canvas or are heading out toward the edge.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b></p>

        </div>

        <p>This contrast was cited in an essay titled &lsquo;An Ecological Artist&rsquo; in a book titled <i>Robert Bateman: An Artist in Nature</i> (1990) written by Rick Archibold. And Archibold concludes in that essay how these two painters differed in their representation of time: &ldquo;Wyeth makes time stand still. Bateman highlights its fleeting quality.&rdquo;</p>
        <!-- <sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Archibold, 1990.">2</a>]</sup> -->

        <p class="linebreak"><i>A moment later all the animals may be gone.</i></p>

        <p class="linebreak">While Bateman is renowned for his paintings of animals, there is great attention to detail in the landscapes for these paintings of animals as well. Many, in effect, are paintings of landscapes where any animal is peripheral to the composition or almost imperceptible. Therein is a principle for Naturalist art that Bob has upheld in the example of his compositions. The principle is this: either the habitat or the animal takes precedence. Not both. When an image is composed around a singular point of interest, its message is brought into a clearer focus.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">Post-Impressionism</h3>
        <p>There are elements of Post-Impressionism and Abstract Expressionism that carry into a Naturalist style of painting. On his personal website&mdash;on a page about painting inspirations and techniques, Robert Bateman describes his attempt at representing the shape of grass, &ldquo;painting the form of the clumps of grass like a pan of muffins, shading each clump and then filling in the details in between.&rdquo; This effect is achieved, as Bob explains, partly with an attention to light and shadow, and partly with just enough detail to create an illusion of reality. Then imagination is invited to fill in the rest.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_2();" title="Robert Bateman on painting.">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <!-- ... natural habitats and the animals that live in them. -->

        <p class="linebreak">This abstract approach is reminiscent of Oriental art styles that trace back to Taoist-inspired art of the Song Dynasty (960-1279) with its visual themes of man set against nature. The art was rather colorless. Nonetheless the painterly compositions of large landscapes and small subjects have influenced Naturalist painters around the world for centuries. The teachings of Taoism advocate for following the &lsquo;way&rsquo;, or the &lsquo;path&rsquo;, and integrating with the natural world. In the West, Taoism is commonly associated with a symbol. The Yang and Yin symbolizes the balance of opposites and the concept of &lsquo;qi&rsquo; as a natural energy running through all things.</p>

        <h4><font class="color text-quote">&ldquo;</font><i>In this art, you see people and animals and trees and mountains and even air as being parts of one whole.

        <p>Light and shadow are fundamental in art. Taken to an extreme, some Abstract Expressionists simplified paintings to dark shapes on a light background or light shapes on a dark background. <i>The Yang and Yin.</i> The balance between dark and light in some of these abstract paintings made it unclear whether the dark shapes superposed the light background or the other way around.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">For example the Abstract Expressionist Franz Kline was famous for bold calligraphic brush strokes projected onto white canvas. Abstract expressions of dark and light were reduced to a simple statement. However, paintings like these were renewed as an inspired trove for pictorial composition in many of the art movements that were set into motion by those of mid-twentieth century New York.</p>

        <p>This extreme of Abstract Expressionism is reminiscent of Chinese or Japanese calligraphy. Like the art of calligraphy, the texture of the brush strokes in Impressionist and later Abstract Expressionist art has an intentionality. The thickness of the paint medium and the weight of each stroke adds a directional, textural aesthetic. These pronounced qualities almost preserve a record of movement in space and time. Like timelapse photography, there is an impression of motion. This process-oriented branch of Abstract Expressionist painting was famously coined by mid-twentieth century New York City-based art critic Harold Rosenberg as action painting because the layered, textured appearance characterizes the painter in motion in front of the canvas. According to Rosenberg, an action painting was not a picture but an event.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_2();" title="D'Augustine, 2010.">4</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">An exhibition of work featuring a number of studio paintings along with scene two at Animat Habitat aims to appropriate some of those painterly aesthetics with cold wax and other impasto mediums and all that.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">More about <a href="../the-beginning-of-painting/" title="Animat Habitat scene two. The Beginning of Painting.">The Beginning of Painting</a>.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">As part of the beginning of painting at Animat Habitat &ndash; in the lead up to an oil painting of an Amur tiger in the taiga &ndash; other works are underway. Of note is a diptych based on an black-and-white pattern of vertical stripes. The stripes are mostly white birch trees. The tall, thin shapes of tree trunks and the spaces in-between comprise the composition. The diptych is titled <i>A Stand of White Birch</i>&mdash;an oil painting of a stand-off with a bull moose in the shade of a paper birch forest, also featuring a yellow-bellied sapsucker.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>A low, diffuse light dimly reflects the white bark of paper birch trees on the fringes of the foreground. The light does not reach far into the forest&mdash;into the distance of the picture. The resulting picture is an interplay of dark and light with spaces where wildlife will blend in-between. A moose meanders through a shadowy mist at dawn. A sapsucker mulls over a spot to start the day. And yet, the animals in this picture are peripheral to the habitat. The forest is the focus: the pattern of the trees.</i></p>

        <p class="linebreak">This diptych is designed with a minimal palette, reserving the use of color, and reducing the darks and lights to a pattern of mid-tones. This minimal palette is, in part, a technical exercise like Robert Bateman took on with <i>Midnight &ndash; Black Wolf</i> (acrylic color, 1989) and again with <i>White Encounter &ndash; Polar Bear</i> (acrylic color, 2005). Again in his writing on inspirations and techniques, Bob describes the challenge to paint most of a painting within a limited range of off-whites, &ldquo;like a composition on a piano in four notes high in the tonal treble clef.&ldquo; And <i>Midnight &ndash; Black Wolf</i> was the opposite challenge, &ldquo;to do most of the painting in four notes of the bass clef.&rdquo;<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_2();" title="Robert Bateman on painting.">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>With all the dark tones in <i>Midnight &ndash; Black Wolf</i> (acrylic color, 1989), Bateman has bade into this painting an air of menace and foreboding that is not present in his earlier paintings of wolves. While the tone may be subtle, in the book <i>Robert Bateman: An Artist in Nature</i> (1990), in a final essay titled &lsquo;Clean Air, Clean Water and the Song of a Bird&rsquo;, author Rick Archibold notes that this painting represented a shift in the explicit nature of Bateman's messaging about nature. Nonetheless, his paintings have so clearly showcased a celebration of nature whether any given statement was made clear or not.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">The Forest</h3>
        <p>When painting a natural environment like the taiga, for example, what separates the trees from the forest is a sense of atmosphere. A misty morning. A dusty day. A partly opaque, particulated air that obfuscates or reflects the light source. This aesthetic of atmosphere appeals to a Naturalist painter because of how mist or dust serves to separate the layers of a landscape.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Atmosphere is about space and a sense of depth within that space. Thus the challenge for a Naturalist painter is to depict the air&mdash;the vast volumes into the distance, the open areas between the trees, the counter shapes in and around clumps of grass and moss and all that.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">All this relates to painting a stand of white birch trees as part of <i>the beginning of painting</i> at Animat Habitat. White birch, or paper birch, has an important ecological history in Mi'kma'ki as well as across many temperate forests on Turtle Island. A stand of white birch has a story to tell. And then there is the painting for scene two made to tell the story of yet another forest: the taiga.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The boreal forest&mdash;the forest that dominates the far north, extending from Russia, in particular where the Amur tiger inhabits, across Europe to North America, is called the taiga. &ldquo;During the winter,&rdquo; narrates Sir David Attenborough in the 2019 nature documentary limited-series <i>Our Planet</i>, in the episode titled &lsquo;Forests&rsquo; that shows the taiga in winter, &ldquo;the days are so short and the temperatures are so low that growth is at a standstill.&rdquo; That far north, the forest supports very few animals. In that part of Siberia, one species of tree sustains all life. The pine tree. If the pine trees fail to fruit in season, deer and boar &ndash; any prey for a tiger &ndash; will move on.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="color quote">

        <h4><font class="color text-quote">&ldquo;</font><i>This is the home of an animal so rare, it is almost mythical. An Amur tiger. There are fewer than six hundred of them. [&hellip;] A male Siberian tiger patrols a territory of almost two-thousand square kilometres, and it has to do so if it is to find enough prey to keep itself alive through the long winter. This is an impoverished land, where food of any kind is scarce. [&hellip;] Poaching has taken the Siberian tiger to the brink of extinction, but since the 1980s their numbers have slowly increased.

        <p>Forests are our most precious ecosystems on the planet. The Amazon rainforest, the Borneo-Mekong rainforests and the Congo rainforest, to name a few, are some of the most important wilderness areas in what remains of the natural world. Of course there are many other important forests ranging from the tropics to the tundras, from the valleys to the mountains. And there are also important forests in the sea. There are kelp forests along many coastlines and there are the great coral reefs&mdash;the rainforests of the sea. The boreal forest, for its part, is estimated to hold hundreds of billions of trees with more than forty per cent of the carbon stored on Earth. Forests, like the rainforests and the taiga, are fundamental in our fight against climate change.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_3();" title="O'Donovan, 2019.">5</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">Robert Bateman, in his book of &lsquo;plates and commentaries&rsquo; published in 1990, <i>Robert Bateman: An Artist in Nature</i>, forewarned the importance of forests in the twenty-first century:</p>

        <div>
          <p><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>Their continued destruction, whether in Europe, China, the Amazon or the Pacific northwest is one of the most serious challenges of conservationists. The amount of forest we have left by the beginning of the next century will have a lot to do with how livable our planet will be for our children and grandchildren.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b></p>

        </div>

        <p>The same can be said, today, of the next century. The same can be said of the next decade. Our inaction, or insufficient action, to mitigate a mass extinction of biological diversity on this planet &ndash; <i>our planet</i> &ndash; has brought our very human world to the very brink of climate catastrophe.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">The Trees</h3>
        <p>We need to plant trees. We need to make sure that trees grow, and making sure that trees grow is more complicated than planting them. Problems arise one way or another with the economics and the politics, not with the logistics, of planting trees. The root of the problem is an extractive, myopic economic model of industrial agriculture and industrial forestry and all that. And in practice and in policy, the environmental costs are too often overlooked.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Our best step forward is to stop cutting down the healthy forests that remain today. This means everywhere law enforcement needs to put an end to illegal logging. All consumers with purchasing power need to boycott the companies that are driving deforestation. And we the people &ndash; and our political representatives &ndash; need to steward the rights of Indigenous peoples who have stewarded local lands and waters since time immemorial. Where there is opportunity for reforestation, local communities need to see benefits from any forest stewardship because the people in those communities will need to be invested in keeping these trees growing.</p>

        <p>As for the forest behind the trees&mdash;for the boreal forest in an oil painting of an Amur tiger in the taiga, as in scene two: <i>White Tiger</i>, the pine trees (and birch trees and so on) are set in the background and largely out of focus. In this painterly scene, the forest is made to be blurred, bordering on Impressionism. There is a compressed sense of the spaces between the trees. The canopy of the forest catches the light en masse. The forest, altogether off in the distance, faded into the light of a sky at dawn, stands in contrast with the intense colors and values of the subject in the foreground. In the midground there is atmosphere. This separation flattens the focus of an otherwise Realist painting of a tiger in the taiga to a Naturalist painting of a tiger as the subject of a scene in the taiga. A tiger was there for a moment. A moment later the tiger is in our imagination.</p>
