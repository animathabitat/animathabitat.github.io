        <p class="linebreak"><em>Virunga</em>&mdash;a Netflix and Grain Media documentary film tells a story of conservation in the context of a war. This first film shares the stakes for park rangers risking their lives to save one of Africa's most precious national parks and its endangered gorillas. <em>In the forested depths of eastern Congo lies Virunga National Park, one of the most biodiverse places on Earth and home to the planetâ€™s last remaining mountain gorillas.</em></p>

        <p>The narrative in Rumangabo, in particular the story of gorilla caretaker Andre Bauma, is a heartening example of dedication to the endangered gorillas in the circumstance of war.

      <div>
        <p>The opening titles for the film strike a visual tone that resonates throughout the score as well as the composition of documentary footage and nature cinematography. The film is scored by Patrick Jonsson, and features an original song &ldquo;<a href="../../../url/yt/iJ9WXvPhTrs/" title="We Will Not Go by J. Ralph Feat. Salif Keita, Youssou Ndour, Fally Ipupa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Will Not Go</a>&ldquo; composed by J. Ralph (featuring Salif Keita, Youssou Ndour and Fally Ipupa). The original song serves as a bookend, underscoring the themes in the opening of the film, then repeating over the end credits and recalling the events of the film. The torn and colorful look of the opening titles, designed by Framestore, directly supports the theme of a war-torn history in Congo as well as reflects the vibrant culture and spirit of its subjects: the Congolese. The pattern of colors applied within the title lettering, of course, is the national flag of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The film, directed by Orlando von Einsiedel, combines investigative journalism and nature documentary in a gripping expos&eacute; of the realities of life in the Congo. The film documents corruption and imposition of <em>big</em> oil companies, namely SOCO, as well as other <em>big</em> interests, such as electronics industries, on an otherwise historically undermined but good natured people who have seen some benefit from tourism driven to the park. Despite claiming in June 2014 that they would halt operations, SOCO had refused to withdraw unconditionally from Virunga by the release of the film.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Ramsey, 2017.">1</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">The film is dedicated to the rangers who gave up their lives in the struggle for peace in eastern Congo.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">Before the Flood (2016)</h3>
        <p>1h 36min</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><em>Before the Flood</em>&mdash;a National Geographic and RATPAC Entertainment documentary film follows Leonardo di Caprio in the role of United Nations messenger of peace on climate change. Di Caprio documents the forewarned crisis of climate change, and addresses problems and solutions with thought leaders from a range of international industries. When a twenty-something years of age di Caprio had an opportunity to meet then vice-president of the United States: Al Gore, the vice-president took the time to warn:</p>

        <div>
          <p>&ldquo;This is the most important issue of our time: all our modes of transportation&mdash;boats, trains, planes, cars, the way we produce our food, the way we build our cities, almost everything we do releases carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and that leads to climate change. The polar ice caps will melt. The seas will start to rise. There will be more dangerous weather patterns: floods, droughts, wildfires.&rdquo;</p>

        </div>

        <p>Leo narrates, &ldquo;It sounded like some nightmarish science-fiction film, except everything [Gore] said is real and it's happening right now.&rdquo; The documentary looks at: &ldquo;how far we have gone, how much damage we have caused, and if there is anything we can do to stop it.&rdquo; The film serves as a wake up call. In this way, the intent is similar to <em>Virunga</em> (2014): to inform as well as to give hope that action can create change for the better, before it becomes too late.</p>

      </div>

      <img alt="Before the Flood banner" src="../../../inc/img/01/title/national-geographic.before-the-flood.banner.jpg" />

      <div>
        <p><em>Before the Flood</em> (2016) is again similar to <em>Virunga</em> (2014) in the way its narrative conflict vilifies fossil fuel interests: in this case, namely the Koch brothers who have financed an echo chamber of climate change denialism. In an interview in the film, professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State University, Michael E. Mann brings this corruption into question: &ldquo;These people are engaged in an effort to lead us astray &ndash; in the name of short term fossil fuel profits &ndash; so that we end up leaving behind a degraded planet. What could be more immoral than that?&rdquo;<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_2();" title="Mann">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak"><em>Before the Flood</em> (2016) is a closer look at the activities, &ldquo;which drove mankind out of the Garden of Eden.&rdquo; The film shares a personal story of shifting baselines, relating back to a motif of religious art: <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em> (1490-1510)&mdash;the modern name given to a triptych oil painting on oak panels painted by Hieronymus Bosch. The triptych is read from left to right, with each panel being essential to the meaning of the whole. The left panel depicts a paradise&mdash;a scene in the Garden of Eden. The right panel illustrates a hell&mdash;a scene in which humans have succumbed to temptations. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the preceding panels is noticeably absent. This final panel strikes a tone in harsh contrast with the earlier two. The central panel&mdash;the panel Bosch called: <em>Human Kind Before the Flood</em>, depicts the expansive garden that gives the triptych its name. Art historians have debated whether the central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost. The film shows both are true in the experience of Leonardo di Caprio, <em>and it's happening right now</em>.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">In the filming of this documentary, in his role as United Nations messenger of peace on climate change, di Caprio had an opportunity to speak with then president of the United States: Barack Obama. The president reflected on the urgency of climate action and this notion of paradise lost:</p>

        <div>
          <p>&ldquo;That is the romantic side of it. That is the side that takes a walk with my daughters and I want them to see the same things I saw as I was growing up. Even if you were unsentimental about that, in very hard-headed terms, you have got to worry about the national security of [climate change]. This is why we have to take action now.&rdquo;</p>

        </div>

        <p>Perhaps the most poignant interview in the film was with former astronaut, and then director of the Earth Sciences division at NASA, GSFC, Piers Sellers.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_2();" title="Sellers">2</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">Sellers recounted being up in orbit, &ldquo;seeing all the cities at night: millions of people all working away, doing something&hellip; come around the day side of the world, seeing the world, all the natural systems, the hurricanes: huge great big wheels over the oceans.&rdquo; Sellers continued, &ldquo;At the end of all that, [he had become] immensely more fond of the planet.&rdquo; The interview brings to account personal contribution in the limited time we have on Earth, and Sellers held hope in humanity:</p>

        <div>
          <p>&ldquo;The facts are crystal clear: the ice is melting, the earth is warming, the sea level is rising. Those are facts. [&hellip;] This is a problem. Let us be realistic and find our way out of it. And there are ways out it.&rdquo;</p>

        </div>

        <p>The film concludes with direction on the personal choices that we can all make. Namely, to consume differently. Consider what you buy, what you eat, how you get your power. And vote. Vote for leaders who will manage climate change by ending fossil fuel subsidies, investing in <em>renewables</em>, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, and supporting a price on carbon.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">The Ivory Game (2016)</h3>
        <p>1h 52min</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><em>The Ivory Game</em>&mdash;a Netflix, Terra Mater Factual Studios and Vulcan Productions documentary film, in association with Malaika Pictures and with Appian Way, tells a story of wildlife crime. The film takes on the perspective of activists around the world on behalf of elephants, in particular African authorities in pursuit of local poaching networks, as well in particular Asian investigators helping to expose the underground legal and illegal market in ivory in China. The film assumes an investigatory style with modern graphics and a modern score, drone footage and undercover footage, nature documentary and tense action surrounding a global criminal network that rivals drug trafficking and human trafficking&mdash;a criminal network of wildlife trafficking. <em>Over the past five years, more than 150,000 elephants have been killed for their ivory. With populations in western and central Africa virtually gone, the mass killing is now spreading to east and southern Africa. Criminal networks smuggle the raw ivory into China, where it is carved into luxury items, fueling a multi-billion dollar trade.</em></p>
      </div>

      <div class="color quote">
        <h4><font class="color text-quote">&ldquo;</font><em>This ivory is being moved subversively across continents, being sold under the table. This is black money. It is fueling international crime. This is an international problem. It is not Africa's problem. The individuals that are fighting this battle, they can not win it alone. It is too big. It is too complex.</em><font class="color text-quote">&rdquo;</font><br><font class="color small thin">&mdash;&nbsp;Iain Craig, director of conservation at Northern Rangelands Trust. <em>The Ivory Game</em> (2016)</font></h4>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Like <em>Virunga</em> (2016), the stakes of life and death are not far from the surface in a documentary such as this. This film follows the venture of two separate investigatory parties, in particular the Intelligence service in Tanzania, NTSCIU, headed by Elisifa Ngowi as well as the Internet platform dedicated to wildlife crime whistle-blowers, <a href="../../../url/-org/wildleaks/" title="Wild Leaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Leaks</a>, headed by Andrea Crosta. Altogether, the two investigations span the story of combating the ivory trade, from the poachers in Africa to the markets in Asia. These ventures serve as the driving force for the film, with a team of people communicating the context alongside the action.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">For Andrea and his network, &ldquo;we want to get as much proof as possible on [top ivory dealers] to show the Chinese government that the illegal trade [&hellip;] is out of hand, to give them more reasons to close down this evil market.&rdquo; For people working with Andrea, in particular Chinese activist and investigative journalist Hongxiang Huang, the exposure of a role on this team aims to counter a common narrative for Chinese people and the ivory market in China. Huang says:</p>

        <div>
          <p>&ldquo;It is very important to let the world see, there are Chinese trying to fight for elephants, as well&mdash;trying to fight back. This could be the turning point of this whole battle for elephants: from now on, China will be part of the solution.&rdquo; </p>

        </div>

        <p>For Elisifa and the ivory war in Tanzania, &ldquo;a one man war can never be won,&rdquo; he says with hope, &ldquo;but if [he] can convince other persons to join [him] in this fight, for sure we can see the number of these endangered animals growing again to the old numbers, where we had over 100,000 elephants in Tanzania.&rdquo;</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The film shines a spotlight on the achievement of these investigations juxtaposed with ivory stockpiles and human-elephant conflict, interweaving the narratives in China and in Tanzania with nature documentary and the conservation work of <a href="../../../url/-org/biglife/" title="Big Life Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Life Foundation</a> in Amboseli National Park, Kenya. The film features Big Life Foundation head of security Craig Miller, with co-founder and director of operations Richard Bonham, whose actions carry a third narrative that cuts to the root of the film: the elephants in Africa. Craig and Richard likewise help to communicate the challenges along the way&mdash;along with rangers managing the conservation of elephants as well as the livelihood of agricultural communities around the national parks and on the fringe of the wild places.</p>

      </div>

      <!-- <div class="color quote">
        <p><font class="color">&ldquo;</font>If [poachers in Africa continue] this business, there is no chance for [their] sons and daughters, or [their] grandsons and granddaughters, to find an elephant in this country.
