        <p>Augmented reality (AR) adds a layer of digital information on top of the physical world around us, and we are already using this technology in many different ways. One of the most common ways is with our smartphones. A few features of phones today make augmented reality technology possible and relatively easy to implement. Key components include a camera as well as sensors like a gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS receiver and compass that enables the smartphone to determine its orientation, the direction that it is pointed in, its general location, and then &ndash; with the camera &ndash; it can use recognition software to figure out exactly where it is and what it is looking at. Once you know where you are, you can start overlaying accurate and designed information on top of the world around you.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Augmented reality is changing the way we view the world, and blurring the line between <i>natural</i> and <i>digital</i>. Everyone from tourists to teachers, to someone looking to share information about the world around them can now benefit from computer-generated graphics, audio and other sensory information superimposed in a real-world environment in real time.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">An Added Perspective</h3>
        <p>For an insight into augmented reality technology, I interviewed a developer to get her perspective. For the past five years, Mai El-Awini has worked in the Labs division of <a href="../../../url/-ca/currentstudios-labs/" title="Current Studios / Labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Current Studios</a>&mdash;an advertising studio in Halifax, Canada. There she developed augmented reality applications that boosted international marketing campaigns into an interactive space. In between projects, Mai helped me develop the companion app for <i>White Elephant</i>.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>First, may you describe your role as lead developer and what about it you find compelling?</i></p>
        <p><font class="color">Mai&mdash;</font>My main responsibility is of course developing. I do as much coding as all the other developers in the company. I also provide support for the junior developers, both technical and practical. Being a team lead then also adds a few managerial tasks to my plate. With every new project I sit with project managers to provide time estimates, plan out milestones, decide which <i>devs</i> on the team are best suited for certain tasks&hellip; things like that. I also lead a weekly <i>dev</i> huddle where the team has a chance to catch up, share knowledge, or bring up any issues.

        <p class="linebreak"><i>Will your upcoming adventures continue to explore the skills you've built in the AR space?</i></p>
        <p><font class="color">Mai&mdash;</font>Augmented reality and virtual reality are becoming more and more mainstream, so I feel like that is something I already have an edge on and will definitely continue to keep on top of. I've gained invaluable knowledge working with 3D artists in-house. It's taught me a lot about that field and how their work integrates with mine. Because our work was usually 3D heavy, we used the gaming engine Unity a lot, so I didn't do as much native iOS and android development as I would have liked. So that's something I'd like to take further in terms of skill sets. Outside the technical world I've learned a lot about client interaction and project management, and in general how a studio runs. One of the perks of being a small studio is you get exposed to everything.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>After five years working professionally in AR, can you succinctly explain augmented reality?</i></p>
        <p><font class="color">Mai&mdash;</font>It's an experience in which our real world interactions are enhanced by virtual content, but most people just have to see it.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>What is your sense of the role of augmented reality technology in the world today?</i></p>
        <p><font class="color">Mai&mdash;</font>Augmented reality is certainly contributing to a more plugged-in society. Whether that's good or bad can be argued both ways I suppose. With mobile devices or computers or video games, there is still that divide that lets you step back into the non-digital world. With AR, we're bringing that digital content into real, physical space and allowing them to coexist simultaneously. There's no longer a divide. I think that has potential to dramatically change the way people interact and the way society evolves.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>Can you offer any predictions for the future of augmented reality?</i></p>
        <p><font class="color">Mai&mdash;</font>I think augmented reality is moving past its &lsquo;gimmicky&rsquo; stage. It was new to people at first, so the wow effect was enough of an experience. Now, I think we'll start seeing it put to more practical use. I can see AR working its way into our day-to-day life very soon. Whether it's assisting us with mundane tasks or providing us with information quicker, I think there are more useful applications of augmented reality still to come.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>What thoughts can you share on the state of wearable technology in 2015?</i></p>
        <p><font class="color">Mai&mdash;</font>Wearables are becoming one more platform that studios want to port their products to. If you're making applications, you want to support smart watches. If it's a health app, tying it to a fitness bracelet is almost expected now by users. At Current [Labs] we've recently started working with different types of headsets to create immersive virtual reality experiences. We've experimented with a couple of augmented reality glasses, but the technology is not quite there yet, in my opinion. The experience isn't user-friendly enough and it feels like it's more of a hassle to use them. Until the hardware is less intrusive and the interaction is more seamless, I don't expect people to start jumping on AR glasses the way they did on other (non-AR) wearables.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>How is augmented reality distinguished from virtual reality (VR) and do you think the advantages of one outweigh the other, now, or in the future?</i></p>
        <p><font class="color">Mai&mdash;</font>Augmented reality enhances physical space with digital content, whereas virtual reality replaces it completely. So, in terms of any advantage, it really depends on what you're trying to achieve. For example, in a lot of gaming applications, VR might make more sense. For other cases where the content is more tied to the user's environment (let's say a maps app), then AR is the better choice. Personally, I find both experiences nauseating when either the software or hardware isn't well designed.</p>

        <p class="linebreak"><i>For young developers starting to develop augmented reality experiences, what are some great resources that we may direct them to?</i></p>
        <p><font class="color">Mai&mdash;</font>I would definitely point them to Qualcomm's <i>Vuforia</i> toolkit. It's a great AR software development kit (SDK) and very popular. I would also point them to Unity if they're looking to tie 3D content to their augmented reality experience. Both can be downloaded by anyone and are free to use (with minor limitations). And the great part is that they're both professionally used in the industry, so you're not wasting your time when learning with them.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Qualcomm">1</a>,&nbsp;<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Unity">2</a>]</sup></p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">An Information Layer</h3>
        <p>Augmented reality may eventually take the form of traditional glasses and contact lenses, with informative graphics that appear in your field of view and react to the movements of your head in real time. While similar devices with applications already exist &ndash; namely smartphones like the iPhone &ndash; augmented reality screen space may soon be seen everywhere. The world, more than ever, is a playground—a place to include a digital layer of interaction with nearby restaurants, tourist attractions and historical sites and so on. It will be up to creatives at the forefront of this technology to imagine the possibilities and to help design the world we want to live in.</p>
