        <p class="linebreak"><em>The making of <em>White Elephant</em> all began in summer of 2010</em>&mdash;<em>this was an animation class term project at the time, with a loose connection to Amboseli National Park. The Greater Amboseli ecosystem is a two million-acre area basking in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro, bordering southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. Amboseli is one of the richest wildlife areas that remain in Africa. The only connection to this animation project was a photograph. This is that photograph: this portrait of an elephant was applied as the front orthographic image plane in the making of a three-dimensional computer-generated model elephant, for example, for an animated short.</em></p>

        <p class="linebreak"><em>This project had not yet begun in July 2010 when, coincidentally, wildlife photographer Nick Brandt had returned to Amboseli. For much of the previous decade, Brandt had spent many months following the elephants there and, as a result, had the opportunity to come to know some of them intimately. This was one of those elephants: the image is simply striking. So much so that this image was used as reference for Ella, the model elephant, and was immediately recognized when a story of a pioneering conservation group &ndash; co-founded by a photographer inspired by wildlife in East Africa &ndash; featured photography of a similarly striking style. The name of this elephant was Igor. He lived largely in Amboseli. This photograph was taken in 2007 and indeed the photographer was the very same</em>&mdash;<em>the one and only Nick Brandt, now co-founder of Big Life Foundation. (This iconic image of Igor is a big part of the visual identity of Big Life Foundation.) The one and only Igor was killed by poachers for his ivory in 2009, two years after this photograph was taken. He was 49 years of age.</em><sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Brandt, 2018">1</a>]</sup></p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">Big Life in Kenya</h3>
        <p>The way in which the photography of Nick Brandt has inspired the art of <em>White Elephant</em> is a microcosm of the way in which the wilderness in East Africa has inspired the work of Big Life Foundation (known as Big Life). Co-founded in 2010 by photographer Nick Brandt, conservationist Richard Bonham, and entrepreneur Tom Hill&mdash;Big Life is on the ground in East Africa, partnering with local communities to protect nature for the benefit of all. For almost a decade, Big Life has collaborated with local communities, partner NGOs, national parks and government agencies to protect over 1.6 million acres of wild lands from deforestation and overgrazing and so on, to sustain the rich wildlife in the Greater Amboseli ecosystem, including one of the last great populations of savanna elephants in Africa.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">In order to protect these elephants, Big Life has become the first organization to establish coordinated anti-poaching operations on both sides of the Kenya-Tanzania border. This has laid groundwork for a two-part land management plan, securing the remaining wild habitat areas in the Amboseli ecosystem and working with local communities to protect that land. The first part negotiates annual leases to hundreds of owners of 60-acre parcels of land located in the Kimana Corridor. These lease payments are intended to limit destructive development of the land, other than that which is compatible with conservation and pastoralism. The second involves working with local communities to protect strategically important wildlife corridors as well as valuable grazing lands to the local livestock economy. This protection can be achieved through the establishment of conservancies, with income-generating opportunities such as tourism. This partnership has pioneered the dangerous game of wildlife protection at Big Life.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Big Life, 2019">2</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">Big Life has demonstrated that sustainable conservation can be achieved through a community-based collaborative approach. Big Life Foundation, by its example, has established a holistic conservation model in the Amboseli-Tsavo-Kilimanjaro ecosystem that can be replicated across the African continent.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">Human-Wildlife Conflict</h3>
        <p>Imagine that you are an African farmer who earns maybe a few thousand dollars in a year from your crops and you discover a big bull elephant trampling through, destroying your very livelihood in just one night. You might be very tempted to throw that spear that protects your ability to feed your family. This is why Big Life has patrol vehicles out every night, patrolling the land where farmland meets wildlife habitat. Big Life also supplies thunder flashes &ndash; harmless noisy pyrotechnics &ndash; to farmers to help them deter elephants, and prevent damage to their crops. And Big Life has seen success: crop raiding has declined, though not by enough. Even on a continent the size of Africa, every day, humans and wild animals are competing for space as farmland and development encroach further upon the wild places.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Settlers have planted crops on ancient migratory routes, and staked their livelihood on what used to be prime elephant habitat. From the perspective of the settlers, the elephants run rampant: eating their way through maize fields, knocking down houses, and trampling on people. From the perspective of the elephants, the settlers are in the way: turning migratory routes and elephant habitat into farmlands that either block passage or come close enough to naturally entice the elephants to forage. As humans expand relentlessly into what was once wilderness, there is ever-more likelihood of conflict with wildlife.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">Wildlife-Human Conflict</h3>
        <p>Imagine that you are an African elephant who walks maybe a few hundred miles along parched stream beds to water and grassland, and along the way you come across a maize field. You remember that your family has walked this way for generations, and maybe you remember that this maize field was not a maize field not that long ago. The landscape has changed: the maize is here now. The maize smells ripe now. This field is the sweetest thing that you have smelled for miles. You are dehydrated and starved, and you feast on the food in front of you and &ndash; for a moment &ndash; all is well. All of a sudden, shrieks! Thunder flashes follow. Worse: gunshots. Creatures with spears that slither in the dark. The kind of creatures that have killed elephants before, maybe elephants who you once knew. You run rampant. You are a wild elephant.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Increasing human-wildlife conflict in the ecosystem is a direct result of wildlife and local communities competing for limited resources on the same shrinking land areas.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">There are no winners of this conflict. Everyone loses.</p>

        <h3 class="linebreak">Wildlife Corridors</h3>
        <p>Elephants like vanilla, and do not like bees. This is a relationship with forest habitats, and an evolved mechanism that helps to protect certain trees. Conservationists have worked with farmers to apply this knowledge in East Africa. Vanilla has been used to encourage elephants to follow new paths along manmade wildlife corridors. Bees have been kept along fences to detract elephants from raiding maize fields and farmlands. Elephant conservationists have used this natural fear to benefit the elephants by placing beehives near farms in order to prevent elephants from foraging in those areas. This approach seems to be helping to minimize incidents of human-wildlife conflict.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_4();" title="Dupuis-D&eacute;sormeaux and Macdonald, 2012">3</a>,&nbsp;<a class="button" onclick="fn_4();" title="King, 2018">4</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">These are two wonderful examples of measures taken to manage the effects of human expansion on elephant habitat. Big Life continues to focus on innovative conservation solutions, continues to establish rapid-response units dedicated to move elephants away from farmlands, and continues to invest in crop-protection fences to deter elephants from entering farmed areas in the first place.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The big picture at Big Life is about protecting the right areas: wildlife corridors.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn_4();" title="Big Life, 2019">5</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>The photography of Nick Brandt from his time in Amboseli speaks for itself, with each portrait speaking of a character in a story with an ending that gave life to Big Life Foundation. These photographs are collected in a trilogy of books documenting the disappearing animals of East Africa, altogether titled: <em>On This Earth, A Shadow Falls Across The Ravaged Land</em>. In the third and final volume, Nick returned to Amboseli for the first time in two years. This time, when he approached, Nick wrote in an essay on conservation, &ldquo;what had once been some of the most relaxed of elephant herds [&hellip;] they would run in terrified panic.&rdquo; This essay introduced the final volume of his trilogy: <em>Across The Ravaged Land</em>, and his words speak to the foundation of Big Life:</p>

But this time, when we approached to within half a mile, they would run in terrified panic. Meanwhile, gunshots were being reported from the direction that the elephants came, near the Tanzanian border.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b></p>

          <p class="linebreak"><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>We tried reporting what we'd seen, but nothing was done, nothing happened.

          <p class="linebreak"><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>Over the next couple of months, the roll call of big bull elephants killed by poachers came thick and fast[&hellip;].

          <p class="linebreak"><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>I saw the destruction unfolding with almost no real or meaningful protection [&hellip;]. It is no good being angry and passive.

        <p>Since its foundation in 2010, Big Life has pioneered wildlife conservation on the ground and in publication. Big Life in Kenya (and Tanzania) has a network of community rangers, mostly Maasai &ndash; the heart of conservation in this region is a partnership with the Maasai, who are traditionally a pastoralist society &ndash; Big Life community rangers actively protect the land by fighting against habitat destruction such as illegal logging or charcoaling, and are expertly trained to tackle a variety of wildlife crimes. Big Life in Canada, in the US and in the UK (and around the world) has campaigned in support of wildlife in East Africa with a story of success based on the strength of partnerships with local communities and embodied in the striking photography of co-founder Nick Brandt.</p>
