This embargo ushered in the &lsquo;golden years&rsquo; for elephants. Demand for ivory was largely eliminated and syndicates that fueled poaching moved to more lucrative products and activities. Elephant populations across Africa stabilised and began increasing for the first time in many decades.

            <p class="linebreak"><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>However, the resumption of elephant hunting [&hellip;] in 1996 and the downgrading [of] Botswana's elephants by CITES to Appendix II changed much of that.

        <h3 class="linebreak">Kavango-Zambezi</h3>
        <p>The elephant population in northern Botswana forms part of a continuous elephant population within southern Africa, as individuals move between bordering countries: Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and until recently, through to Angola. These countries comprise the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA), one of the largest conservation areas in the world. Now, there is an increased urgency for those neighboring countries to open protected corridors so herds can return to their traditional ranges.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Bell and Pinnock, 2019">2</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">The reality is that elephants share the landscape with an ever-increasing human population. This conflict reflects competition not only for resources such as water and vegetation, but also for space, especially as an estimated 78 per cent of the elephant range occurs outside of national parks. The result is more frequent incidents of human-wildlife conflict.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Bell and Pinnock, 2019">2</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>Elephant movements in (and out of) northern Botswana are long-range, temporally complicated, seasonally variable, and closely linked with rainfall.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Chase et al, 2005">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">Elephants numbers in Botswana are in sharp contrast with numbers in Angola, which has fewer than 4,000 elephants in a fertile country almost double the size of Botswana. The contrast is similar with Zambia, which has only around 22,000 elephants. Yet both Zambia and Angola have vast tracks of traditional elephant habitat lying dormant and underutilized. This unbalance holds an answer to any question of whether or not Botswana can sustain its current elephant population.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">This is where the KAZA TFCA initiative comes into the picture. KAZA TFCA is an agreement signed by Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, binding these countries to create a transfrontier park straddling their national borders and covering the size of roughly France or Texas. The centre of of the area is at the confluence of the Chobe and Zambezi rivers, where the borders of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe meet. Chobe National Park, Hwange National Park, the Okavango Delta and Victoria Falls are all contained within the Transfrontier Conservation Area. The vision is: &lsquo;to establish a world-class transfrontier conservation and tourism destination in the Okavango and Zambezi river basin regions [&hellip;] within the context of sustainable development.&rsquo; The crux will be whether KAZA stakeholders have the political will to open up ancient elephant corridors to connect the elephants in Botswana to those well-stocked food pantries waiting for them to the north in Nambia, Zambia and Angola. If these corridors can be recreated, it will be a win-win situation for all member countries and their rural communities.</p>

        <p>By 2007, Michael Chase and Kelly Landen co-founded Elephants Without Borders (EWB) and managed nearly fifty fitted satellite collars on elephants in northern Botswana, Namibia and Zambia. In 2007, this was the largest telemetry study of elephants. These telemetry studies, coupled with population assessments and trends brought to light in the aerial surveys undertaken by EWB, were used to delineate the boundaries of the KAZA TFCA&mdash;the agreement under which Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Angola formally acknowledged that wildlife conservation transcended national boundaries.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">By 2011, an aerial survey commissioned by the Botswana department of wildlife and national parks, conceptualized and led by Michael Chase and Kelly Landen of Elephants Without Borders, &ldquo;[made evident] a catastrophic loss of wildlife,&rdquo; according to Chase, eleven species were in serious decline in the delta. The declines were a result of a complex mix of local causes: human encroachment, game fences and poaching, fires and drought and so on. Elephants, however, were bucking the trend. Chase had an explanation:</p>

        <div class="clear-bottom">
          <p><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>We found the number of elephants in northern Botswana has stabilised at about 130,000. One reason is that they're returning to Angola. The country is remembered by a generation of elephants still alive today. They recognise the pathways to food and water and the timing of seasons. They remember where the hunters are. In a sense, they're Angolan refugees returning home.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b></p>

          <p class="linebreak"><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>The bulls are the scouts, leaving the vicinity of Botswana's conservation areas on exploration journeys. They move from the delta up the Kwando River, streak across the Caprivi at night and into Angola. They find it's pristine, with few people. There are thought to be millions of landmines in south-east Angola. I don't know how they avoid them &ndash; probably by smell &ndash; but they do. Then they return and fetch the family herds. [&hellip;] They look for food and water, but they're also searching for peaceful sanctuaries far from humans.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b></p>

        <p>Botswana-based Elephants Without Borders went on to lead a ground-breaking initiative to survey elephants and animals across Africa. The results of the <a href="../../../url/-org/elephantswithoutborders-great-elephant-census/" title="Elephants Without Borders / Great Elephant Census" target="_blank">Great Elephant Census</a> (GEC) painted a bleak picture of the pan-African situation in 2014: fewer than 400,000 savanna elephants survived in Africa. During the previous seven years, ivory poaching had reduced elephant populations across the continent by 30 per cent. 144,000 elephants. Poaching and human-wildlife conflict and habitat loss and drought are so intense that elephant populations are shrinking by eight per cent each year, continent-wide. 28,000 elephants a year. 76 elephants a day. One elephant every 20 minutes. So it goes.</p>

            <p class="linebreak"><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>While Khama's anti-hunting policies created a photo-safari boom, one of his biggest mistakes was not to fill the voids created when he banned hunting at the end of the 2013 safari season.

Furthermore, a number of rural Okavango communities had the revenues they earned channeled away from them into the new Land Bank that was set up and controlled by the central government.

            <p class="linebreak"><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>There has also been little clear policy direction on how communities can effectively deal with roving elephants that destroy crops and harass &ndash; even kill &ndash; people.

        <p class="linebreak">In a twist of fate in 2018, an interim president of Botswana decided to lift a five-year ban on hunting elephants and so on.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) was split when former president Ian Khama opposed his appointed successor and acting president, Mokgweetsi Masisi, for departing party values. Despite Khama coming out of political retirement to unite the opposition parties, the BDP was re-elected in 2019. The BDP has governed ever since Botswana's independence in 1966.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The decision to lift the ban on hunting elephants was considered popular among rural voters. Today in Botswana, there is indeed a large and stable population of elephants living on the fringe of more and more farmland. Don Pinnock considers the motives for a sudden shift in wildlife policy:</p>

        <div>
          <p><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>Questions being asked are whether President Masisi's wildlife policy changes are out of genuine concern for the well-being of rural communities and elephants, out of embarrassment at the unanticipated surge in poaching under his watch &ndash; or simply to consolidate votes. It is not clear whether he (or his advisors) fully realise that the high regard in which Botswana is currently held by the international safari tourist market could be irreparably damaged by opening sport hunting of elephants.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b></p>

        </div>

        <p>The real solution is to allow these elephants safe passage to past, now underutilized, home ranges in Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and safe passage back to Botswana with the change of season. The solution is to protect the wild places in the Kavango-Zambezi area for elephants. This solution calls for a reconsidered land management plan in Caprivi. This solution requires the recreation and preservation of wildlife corridors across Botswana's northern border and throughout managed farmland and so on. This solution has the potential to spark a tourism industry that can benefit local communities with revenue and employment in all five KAZA countries. Today, the future of elephants in Botswana is once again up for debate and this time there is a far reaching implication for the future of elephants in Africa.</p>
