        <p>EST. 2015, CANADA&mdash;Art studio in support of wildlife conservation is established in Canada as not-for-profit organization no. 942675-2.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The name of the studio&mdash;<a href="../../../" title="Animat Habitat">Animat Habitat</a> is lettered in the corporate seal along with the motto: <em>Anim&amacr;lia fera mund&imacr; n&amacr;t&amacr;ralis anim&amacr;re</em>. &ldquo;Animat&rdquo; is the third-person singular, indicative present, conjugation of the Latin verb <u>anim&amacr;re</u> &ldquo;to animate&rdquo;, &ldquo;to give life to&rdquo;. Altogether, the motto translates: To give life to the wild animals of the natural world.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Animat Habitat acknowledges its foundation in Mi’kma’ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq People. This territory is covered by the “Treaties of Peace and Friendship” which Mi’kmaq and other First Nations Peoples first signed with the British Crown in 1726. The treaties did not deal with surrender of lands and resources but in fact recognized Mi’kmaq title and established the rules for what was to be an ongoing relationship between nations. &#47;&#47;<a href="../../../url/-ca/rcaanc-cirnac-gc/" title="Peace and Friendship Treaties">rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">1 September 2015&mdash;Animat Habitat is founded by <a href="../../../url/git/danealeksander/" title="Dane Aleksander, graphic artist.">Dane Aleksander</a>, with the aim to create art in support of the wild places and the animals that live in them. Dane Aleksander, founder and graphic artist in Halifax, shares the idea: &ldquo;that illustrating beauty in nature through the lens of interactive media can give rise to an unprecedented voice in support of wildlife conservation.&rdquo; This art studio is a space to explore meaningful stories for wildlife conservation in Canada, and across North America and so on. The first studio project is focused on the plight of elephants in Africa.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The hope for wildlife in Africa is perhaps best summarized in the introduction of the talk radio show: <em>Our Wild World</em> with host Eli Weiss, &ldquo;Africa is at a crossroads, on the brink of possibilities. [Therein, in particular in the national parks and in the corridors in-between, is hope for wildlife.] In Africa, it is still possible to make a difference.&rdquo; Still more and more species are being driven to extinction in the wild. In response, Animat Habitat looks to the iconic animals: the keystone and umbrella species, and aims to create constructive art to help conserve their ecosystems and the biodiversity that cascades from their presence. Animat Habitat is here to give voice to the wild animals in art. The date of release of a first publication is yet to be determined, however, a library of scenes in wildlife art is now officially in production at Animat Habitat. &#47;<a href="../../../scene/one/making-of-ella-2/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un.
