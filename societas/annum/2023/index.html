        <h2>Annual Letter</h2>
        <h5>Kjipuktuk &ndash; Halifax, NS Canada</h5>
        <h5>Preceded by: <a href="../2022/" title="Animat Habitat &ndash; Annual Address">Annual Address</a>, 2022</h5>

        <p class="linebreak">ANIMAT HABITAT&mdash;<i>Less slowly&hellip;</i> The holocene has ebbed out. Then, like something out of the blue&ndash;unclouded heavens, wildfires have raged around the world and into where wildfires have not burned before: above the arctic circle. This calendar year will soon be officially confirmed as the warmest on human record. The skies have billowed with our forsaken forests. The seas have bloomed with our plastics and pollutants. There are now microplastics in our blood and toxic particulates in the air we breathe and so on.</p>

        <!-- Following months of record-breaking rainfall, floods, heat waves... -->

        <p class="linebreak lineend">Less and less slowly&hellip; The studio presses on. Studio expenses are managed in four categories: hardware, software, fees and development.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Art Hardware: CA$3,033;</li>
          <li>Computer Art Software: CA$140;</li>
          <li>Expenses and Fees: CA$100;</li>
          <li>Research and Development: CA$387;</li>
          <li>Total Investment (Year): CA$3,661.</li></ul>

        <p class="linebreak">A notable expense at the studio this year was Serif Affinity V2 Universal License for Designer, Photo and Publisher creative suite on Windows and now also on macOS and iPadOS. And one more thing&hellip; A MacBook.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">For the first time in more than a decade, Animat Habitat has a new computer art studio suite. Also for the first time, that studio suite operates Apple macOS Ventura &ndash; soon Sonoma. And there are two reasons for why that is important. For one, studio access to an up-to-date computer operating system enables a secure software environment for commerce and communication on the Web. For two, studio access to the latest macOS makes possible Swift application development within Apple Xcode, whether in collaboration with a developer or in-house.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">This computer art studio suite is dedicated to giving a voice to nature. However, that does not forgive the causalities and the conditions of mining of rare metals. These minerals make up the material advancements in computer technology. Computer hardware comes at a cost. There is a price paid by consumers. Then there is a material imbalance in between. Beyond demands for human rights around the world, people are deeply indebted to nature. <i>And that debt has not even been added up.</i></p>

        <p class="linebreak lineend">Notable studio expenses are listed below.</p>

        <h5>Computer Art Hardware [of 3 items]:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Apple MacBook Pro: CA$2,989 <i>2023</i></li>

        </ul>

        <h5 class="linebreak">Computer Art Software [of 1 items]:</h5>

        <p class="letterhead">CORPORATE WEBSITE&mdash;Development for the official website of Animat Habitat has moved to a monthly release cycle. Updates to Web pages were committed on the first day of each month. The version was incremented and is now version 2.1.9 and so on.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">All articles published in the &lsquo;Art and story&hellip; and elephants&rsquo; project broadcast were edited and republished in March. ~&#47;scene/one/<a href="../../scene/one/making-of-ella/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Animat Habitat scene one. Making of Ella, 1.">making-of-ella</a>/</p>

        <p class="letterhead">SCENE ONE&mdash;The first production at Animat Habitat is behind a digital lens focused on cinematography and on Ella the elephant and so on.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">SCENE TWO&mdash;The beginning of painting has continued&hellip; A small study of a tiger was painted with a sample of coral oil color. A pair of thirty- by fifteen-inch gallery pieces painted on a linen canvas and on a birch board will be next. This work will constitute the second scene at Animat Habitat and the hope is that these two paintings will serve as the showcase for a first exhibition of studio artwork&hellip; In 2025. ~&#47;scene/two/<a href="../../scene/one/making-of-ella/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Animat Habitat scene two. The Beginning of Painting.">the-beginnning-of-painting</a>/</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Also in the works is a diptych codenamed &lsquo;White Birch&rsquo;. The pair of paintings painted on two birch boards will show a stand-off with a bull moose in the shadow of a stand of birch trees. Both birch boards will be exhibited along with <i>White Tiger</i> in 2025. In this case, the focus of the paintings will be the forest habitat. And this work will be titled &lsquo;A Stand of White Birch&rsquo;.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Art of <i>White Tiger</i> and &lsquo;A Stand of White Birch&rsquo; aim to support boreal forest and birch forest conservation in Canada. A third painting&mdash;a collage of birch boards framing a North Atlantic Right Whale will aim to support marine conservation in Atlantic Canada. Right here in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This third painting has been designed, in part, as a progressive disclosure of more information about scene three at the studio. More information to come.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">CONSERVATION CHAMPION&mdash;The wildlife cinematography of Rolf Steinmann is featured in a number of BBC natural history documentaries and Disney Nature films, in particular this year in the BBC Earth series <i>Frozen Planet II</i> (2022) and in the Disney Nature film <i>Polar Bear</i> (2022). The wildlife cinematographer also appears in front of the lens in a number of BBC behind-the-scenes diaries, at the end of each episode, and in a number of the companion Disney making-of films, this year, in particular, in the Disney Nature companion making-of film <i>Bear Witness</i> (2022). In this way, with a few humble words and a whole lot of time stationed behind the camera, Rolf stands uniquely positioned as a champion for wildlife conservation. Rolf Steinmann was recognized as a principle champion at Animat Habitat for his cinematography of wildlife in the Arctic and Antarctic and in between. &#47;&#47;vimeo.com&#47;rolf-steinmann&#47;<a href="../../../url/vimeo/148059977/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Vimeo / Rolf Steinmann / In Between">in-between</a>/</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Animat Habitat maintains a subscription to National Geographic digital magazine in support of National Geographic explorers and, in particular, the environmental journalists behind the National Geographic wildlife watch program. We also continue to support the Okavango Wilderness Project in partnership with National Geographic Society and the Botswana Wild Bird Trust. These programs continue to provide telling, timely updates on the state of the Okavango watershed. &#47;&#47;nationalgeographic.com&#47;<a href="../../-www/nationalgeographic-reconafrica-pause-drilling-namibia" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="National Geographic / Wildlife Watch / Canadian oil company pauses controversial drilling in Namibian wilderness">reconafrica-pause-drilling</a>&hellip; &#47;&#47;nationalgeographic.org&#47;<a href="../../-org/nationalgeographic-okavango/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="National Geographic Society / Okavango Wilderness Project">okavango</a>&#47;</p>
        <!-- US$35 -->

        <p class="linebreak">Right now, the Okavango delta does have formal protection, but its source in Angola &ndash; comprising lakes and rivers that flow into the delta &ndash; does not.

          We continue to watch along with National Geographic and National Geographic Society. And this year, we honor Thalefang Charles, who is helping to tell the story of the people of the delta.</p>

        <!-- It's also an important part of the bigger picture of conservation and achieving more protection in the region. More than one million people who reside in the basin - spanning Angola, Namibia and Botswana - depend on this ecosystem for water and food security. But the effects of climate change, deforestation, water diversion, and other threats are putting the source waters at risk. -->

        <p class="linebreak">Thalefang Charles was part of the expedition that paved the way for the creation of the Okavango Wilderness Project in 2015. Charles has experienced how inhabitants of the delta and the surrounding area are uniquely adapted to life in the region, including human-wildlife coexistence, and thus are in the best position to enact solutions. The delta is not just about the wildlife. There are villages there. There are people. There are ways of life that are unique to the rivers and water tower. By engaging local leaders, and recording audio interviews on the most pressing issues in the region, Charles has shared a better understanding of how to assist in sustainable protection of these communities, waterways and wildlife. Thalefang Charles was recognized as a principle champion at Animat Habitat for his chronicles of Indigenous knowledge across the Okavango Delta. &#47;&#47;nationalgeographic.com&#47;<a href="../../../url/www/nationalgeographic-thalefang-charles-explorer-story/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="National Geographic / Thalefang Charles storytelling is helping safeguard the Okavango Delta and Indigenous knowledge">thalefang-charles</a>&hellip;</p>

        <p class="letterhead">CONSERVATION&mdash;Animat Habitat received a Ranger Club badge for continued support of Big Life Foundation. This honorary title mirrors the titles of rangers at Big Life. Like most Maasai who become rangers, we have started as a &lsquo;Scout&rsquo;. The studio objective as a Ranger Club member is part of a sustainable funding model for the conservation projects we believe in and want to support into the future. This year in Amboseli, this has meant securing habitat and signing conservation leases with local Maasai landowners to secure important wildlife corridors. Part of the greater Amboseli ecosystem was turned to a subdivision. And so Big Life Foundation has been working with local people to ensure that there will still be open rangelands and habitat for both wild and domestic animals to coexist. &#47;&#47;<a href="../../../url/-org/biglife/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Big Life Foundation">biglife.org</a></p>

        <!-- Some day, we hope to rise to Chief Warden Scout. -->

        <p class="linebreak">We have also continued to support keepers at Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. We have mourned tragic loss, this year, at the Umani Springs reintegration unit. And we thank the keepers for their dedication and devotion. &#47;&#47;<a href="../../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sheldrick Wildlife Trust">sheldrickwildlifetrust.org</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">We have signed petitions for nature&mdash;for a &lsquo;global deal for nature&rsquo; and for African wild dogs and so on. <i>The wild animals always have no comment.</i></p>

        <p class="linebreak">A bit about African wild dogs.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Each day, African wild dogs will cover more than twenty kilometres on a hunt. This movement makes them highly susceptible to snares. All the while, unsustainable development is fragmenting African wild dog habitat, which only increases conflict with humans and contact with livestock. This then increases the risk of endemic disease outbreaks in both livestock and wildlife populations. The African wild dog population is now just numbered in the six thousands. And still decreasing.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Today, there is a dichotomy between conservation and development as Africa tips past tipping points for land use on the continent. In reality, there is a way forward for both. This way forward must engage communities and governments alike to ensure that natural habitats remain intact and to empower Indigenous peoples to manage the biodiversity there where they sustain a way of life. This way forward must bring together African leaders and policymakers &ndash; from the grassroots level to heads of state &ndash; in a movement to protect natural habitats, support sustainable livelihoods, and ensure that human rights are at the core of conservation strategies. And just this year, African Wildlife Foundation convened an inaugural IUCN Africa Protected Areas Congress&mdash;a first-of-its-kind gathering of leaders from around the continent aimed at finding a way forward on these key issues. &#47;&#47;awf.org&#47;<a href="../../../url/-org/awf-apac/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="African Wildlife Foundation / Africa Protected Areas Congress">apac</a>&#47;</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Also this year, we called on world leaders to support a &lsquo;Global Deal for Nature&rsquo;&mdash;a plan to protect and restore half of the lands and oceans on Earth. &#47;&#47;<a href="../../../url/-org/globaldealfornature/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Global Deal for Nature">globaldealfornature.org</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">Here &ndash; in the global north and in the western world &ndash; we have to do better. We now have to recover after hellish, high-intensity fire seasons &ndash; including in Canada, following our worst wildfire season in recorded history. The climate crisis is upon us. And we have to recover now. A key part of our recovery is to reforest with biodiversity and resiliency in mind, in an effort to mitigate these fires in the future. In practice, this means following a lot of indigenous knowledge in terms of planting the understory below the canopy as well as planting more fire-resistant, deciduous trees, instead of prioritizing the lots of coniferous trees that have so far built up the logging industry.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">A bit about human industry, today.</p>

        <div>
          <p><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>The industrial revolution, which was fuelled by slavery and colonization, brought unimaginable wealth to the global north, and in particular to a small minority of people living there. That extreme injustice is the foundation that our modern societies are built upon. This is the very heart of the problem. It is the suffering of the many that have paid for the benefits of the few. Their fortune came at a price, namely oppression, genocide, ecological destruction and climatological instability. There is a bill for all this destruction that has not yet been paid. In fact, it has not even been added up.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b> &mdash;&nbsp;Greta Thunberg, <i>The Climate Book</i> (2022) &#47;&#47;penguinrandomhouse.com&#47;<a href="../../../url/-com/penguinrandomhouse-the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Penguin Random House / Greta Thunberg / The Climate Book (2022)">the-climate-book</a>&hellip;</p>

          <!-- Climate Book, 1.5 -->

        </div>

        <p>The collaborative, collective book on climate, published in 2022 by the great Greta Thunberg, <i>The Climate Book</i> points to a range of climate issues from a reel of expert perspectives, and yet, in large part, through the lens of a limited lull in time after March 2020 but before February 2022. The climb out of a global pandemic and then decent into an international conflict will have distracted political discourse on climate. In the lobbies of power, priority of investment will have reverted from the environment to the medical- and military-industrial complexes.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Even still, even environmental concerns for the Kavango basin are addressed in this great book on climate. Part five&ndash;chapter seventeen points to concerns for the elephants and the delta ecosystem from the perspective of Ina Maria Shikongo, a co-founder of the <i>Fridays For Future</i> grassroots organization in Windhoek, Namibia. &#47;&#47;climatejusticecentral.org&#47;<a href="../../../url/-org/climatejusticecentral-ina-maria-shikongo-my-struggle/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Climate Justice Central / Teneal Koorts / Ina Maria Shikongo - My struggle">ina-maria-shikongo</a>&hellip;</p>

        <div>
          <p><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>The Kavango basin [&hellip;] is currently under threat. Recon Africa, a gas and oil company from Canada, is hoping to extract a hundred and twenty billion barrels of oil from the area, leading and oil industry publication to ask if this is the largest oil play of the decade. [&hellip;] Over the past five hundred years, African people have been oppressed and have lost their land to foreigners. Recon Africa is not only coming to Namibia to pollute [its] water and destroy [its] environment and ecosystem, [the gas and oil company] is threatening to disrupt the ways of the Kavango and the San peoples who live off the lands, working as subsistence farmers and hunter-gatherers. And the Kavango basin is also home to the Okavango delta—the habitat of the largest living population of endangered African elephants and of many more threatened species. [&hellip;] There is only one Kavango&mdash;only one Okavango delta. What happens in Kavango will not stay in Kavango.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b></p>

        </div>

        <p>We condemn Recon Africa in its effort to probe for profit on the wrong side of history. Someone, somewhere had to stand up for nature in Namibia. And we encourage and follow Ina in her grassroots movement. But the world must also come together to phase out fossil fuels and plastic products and so on.</p>
