        <p>ANIMAT HABITAT&mdash;<a href="../../../" title="Animat Habitat">Animat Habitat</a> has accrued a cumulative operating loss through its financial year end of 2016 of ~CA$35,000. This figure represents a significant percentage of the initial fund that was directed to advance the studio to a first publication of wildlife art. The sum total has accounted for a select record of investments &ndash; some of which have predated the organization &ndash; all of which have made possible the progress of the organization to date. The capital investment is a computer art studio suite made to produce a library of scenes in wildlife art, which has a capacity to multiply the return on that investment given a market for constructive art in support of wildlife conservation. Studio projects take time and capital investment. These projects then exist in perpetuity, in many cases in a digital art form that is transacted at little cost relative to the studio, to the environment and to the audience and so on. All revenue from the official digital publication of studio projects is to be directed as a donation to wildlife conservation projects on the ground. Studio projects are also made to be available in part as a public digital archive, so that more and more people have an opportunity to connect with stories of the wild places and the animals that live in them. The first publication at the studio is designed to lay down this foundation.</p>

        <ul class="linebreak lineend">
          <li>Computer Art Hardware: CA$8,790;</li>
          <li>Computer Art Software: CA$8,623;</li>
          <li>Expenses and Fees: CA$12,238;</li>
          <li>Research and Development: CA$5,558;</li>
          <li>Sum Total Investment: CA$35,210.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Term of Investment">1</a>]</sup></li></ul>

        <p>Investment at the studio may be categorized into four types of overhead cost: hardware, software, fees and development. Any expired resource such as a rented work space, and a subscription service and so on is kept to a minimum. Any select hardware &ndash; as well as licensed animation and design software &ndash; is perceived as capital investment to produce commercial art at the studio, which in future may generate support for wildlife conservation. Computer art hardware and software is selected with consideration of craftsmanship and sustainability as part of a direction to maximize return on investment&mdash;to benefit projects in future. The hardware is also selected with consideration of cost to manufacture and use of materials: the material waste, the mining and use of rare-earth metals (oft-used for batteries, magnets, microchips and so on) and so on. Software architecture is less of a tangible tax on the environment. So it goes.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The computer art studio suite at Animat Habitat is an investment in part regarded as a proud contribution to the companies that engineer such inspiring hardware and software tools. This investment is like any contribution made in support of an inspiring artist or a work of art, and is justified in pursuit of that which has inspired the founding of this studio. In this case, the figure for any single year is a less accurate account of the corporate standing. Instead, the net gains or losses over a longer term is of more significance to the advancement of the core mission: to save the wild places and the animals that live in them.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">CORPORATE WEBSITE&mdash;The official website of Animat Habitat was branched off of the project broadcast: <em>Art and story&hellip; And elephants.</em> There, project updates were shared under the umbrella of the portfolio website of <a href="../../../url/git/danealeksander/" title="Dane Aleksander">Dane Aleksander</a>, founder and interim president, public accountant and secretary and so on. The official website of Animat Habitat was designed and developed with the open-sourced WordPress information architecture, and with a custom CSS theme based on the visual identity of the organization. The visual identity was described in detail in an organizational document published as Animat Habitat canon, or corporate style guide or lookbook, version 1. Included in the visual identity is a transcription of the mission statement and the tone of voice of the studio. This language is echoed in the documents of incorporation.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">SCENE ONE&mdash;Animat Habitat scene one: <a href="../../../scene/one/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un."><em>White Elephant</em></a> has entered into the animation stage of the animated short film production. The project has a color script, character art, environment art, a story, technical direction for character animation, and a rough animatic with blocking, sequencing and pacing and so on. The project has rendering, audio engineering and video compositing to come. This first publication at Animat Habitat has its digital release scheduled in the first quarter of 2020, and is made to be a dedicated source of revenue for wildlife conservation in Africa. Then, a printed version may be made available to realize the multimedia art in its &ndash; in part &ndash; tangible form. A limited edition print run may also present an opportunity for the studio to see a return on invested capital. From a financial perspective, however, this first project is recognized as a likely loss leader.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">A more tragic loss. Long days at the studio here in Canada have been far too short when &ndash; at times in the making of <em>White Elephant</em> &ndash; in Africa, an elephant was being poached on average every fifteen minutes. For years, on average, nearly one hundred elephants were killed for their tusks every day. There was an estimated 350,000 elephants in the wild in 2013. An estimated 35,000 were killed in that same year, mostly to fuel an ivory trade that continues to fund a global criminal network, and to deprive Africa, and the world, of its nature and its treasure: wildlife. The fate of elephants in the wild is in our hands. &#47;scene&#47;one&#47;<a href="../../../scene/one/history-of-elephants-ivory/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un. A History of Elephant Conservation.">elephant-ivory</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">This focus on elephants and on other iconic animals &ndash; the umbrella species &ndash; is by popular demand. Saving the elephants in Africa is about protecting the habitats where elephants live, so that they and the animals that fall under an <u>umbrella</u> of the ecosystems they create may continue to coexist in the wild. Saving places for wild animals is also about human communities on the fringe of wilderness and the ever-encroaching agricultural development. The focus at Animat Habitat is to create a visual history of the natural world that may encourage people to appreciate wildlife and to conserve a world with wild places.</p>
