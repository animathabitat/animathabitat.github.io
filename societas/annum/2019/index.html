        <p class="lineend">ANIMAT HABITAT&mdash;<em>A silence before the storm.</em> The initial term of investment &ndash; through the financial year end of 2019 &ndash; has closed with a net zero valuation, and a renewed term of investment &ndash; through the financial year end of 2029 &ndash; was secured with a framework for future projects at Animat Habitat. The framework includes a finance and a site proposal for the official series of studio publications. The renewed term of investment has ensured that the non-profit organization has access to non-solicited funding for the next ten years.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Term of Investment">1</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak">The finances of the first four years at the studio was accounted at ~CA$40,000 (seven per cent over the previous year). The studio expenses were limited to ~CA$2,500 in the 2019 financial year. These expenses are managed in four categories: hardware, software, fees and development.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Art Hardware: CA$2,406;</li>
          <li>Computer Art Software: CA$55;</li>
          <li>Expenses and Fees: CA$70;</li>
          <li>Research and Development: CA$74;</li>
          <li>Total Investment (Year): CA$2,605.</li></ul>

        <p class="linebreak lineend">The sum total investment was accumulated in each category, then adjusted for any capital loss and short-term expense and so on.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Art Hardware: CA$12,113 [89 pct. &ndash; CA$10,819];</li>
          <li>Computer Art Software: CA$9,218 [54 pct. &ndash; CA$4,982];</li>
          <li>Expenses and Fees: CA$12,466 [5 pct. &ndash; CA$624];</li>
          <li>Research and Development: CA$6,388 [33 pct. &ndash; CA$2,133];</li>
          <li>Sum Total Investment: CA$40,185. [46 pct. &ndash; CA$18,558].</li></ul>

        <p class="linebreak">Sum total investment at the studio has a net valuation at ~CA$18,500. This is a reflection of the current state of the computer art studio suite and the current market value of its net assets. The studio also manages stock of published studio artwork with an added valuation at ~CA$5,000. The published corporate identity of the studio has a valuation that is yet to be determined. The studio has a sum total valuation that is estimated at net zero.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">A notable expense at the studio this year was a result of a hardware failure that shut down production in October through November of 2018. A five-year-old Quadro K4000 workstation video card turned into an expensive bookend, and was replaced by the newer and nicer-named Quadro P4000 workstation video card. A power supply unit (PSU) and an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) was also replaced in the event that a surge, or decline, in power supply was a root cause of the hardware failure. The root cause for the unresponsive video card was just as likely a result of prolonged production use. Computer systems will degrade with use, and can devalue with the advancement of technology and time and so on. The computer was reevaluated and equipped with the new video card by December of 2019. The computer art studio suite was not only ready for production use, the improved specifications for the <em>Windows 7</em> system were now at the maximum <em>Windows Index Score</em> in all categories (7.9). <em>A positive note.</em></p>

        <p class="letterhead">CORPORATE WEBSITE&mdash;The official website of the organization was cached on <u>Cloudflare</u> to improve access for members around the world now and in future. The animathabitat.com and periwinkle.blue domains of the organization were also moved to Cloudflare as part of a transition to the fair pricing registry service.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">CORPORATE CANON&mdash;A first revision of the corporate canon was approved for publication with <u>Serif Affinity Publisher</u> upon the anticipated release of the publishing software in 2019. This computer art software has completed a trinity of the Affinity suite: Design, Photo and Publisher. This was part of a continued measure taken at the studio in response to a subscription paradigm.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">SCENE ONE&mdash;The first publication has a revised color script and transcript and so on. The short animation has a long, long-awaited journey ahead, with an elephant across a sea of sand. The visual art of <a href="../../scene/one/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un."><em>White Elephant</em></a> aims to share a perspective of beauty in nature at a safe distance&mdash;at a small price of attention, and with a call for contribution to the conservation of the natural world. The project is meant to promote preservation and protection of the wild places and the animals that live in them. This is equally in the interest of the people and of the planet. We the people need to consider our interest in context of the health of the planet. This bigger picture holds many big challenges: current climate challenges and future worse-climate challenges and so on. By choice, or by chance, we are lost and found somewhere in the middle of that long, long-forgone journey together.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The focus of the first publication at Animat Habitat has become increasingly resolved to help protect the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. This area holds a water system that comes from Angolan highlands, passes through the abandoned plains of landmines remnant from a war-torn Angola, then passes through the Caprivi Strip in Namibia, before the flood spills into Botswana&mdash;into an invaluable basin in the heart of the Kalahari Desert. The studio has allocated a third and fourth selection to receive revenue from the art of <em>White Elephant</em> directed to conservation projects on the ground: one in Namibia and one in Botswana. Two candidate projects have been identified: <a href="../../../url/-org/ehranamibia/" title="EHRA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elephant - Human Relations Aid</a> (EHRA) in Namibia and <a href="../../../url/-org/elephantswithoutborders/" title="Elephants Without Borders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elephants Without Borders</a> (EWB) based in Botswana. More will be considered, however, these two projects are worth consideration for support. <em>To be continued.</em></p>

        <p class="letterhead">OTHER PROJECTS&mdash;<a href="../../../url/git/bigtuskers/" target="_blank" title="Last of the Big Tuskers (documentary film, 2018)"><em>Last of the Big Tuskers</em></a> (2018) has continued to enter film festivals in 2019. The documentary about Tembe Elephant Park in South Africa was an official selection for <u>Wildlife Conservation Film Festival</u> in New York, <u>Nature Track Film Festival</u> in California, and <u>Elements International Environmental Film Festival</u> in Vancouver and so on. The film has received a few awards and has saved the best for last, for a screening in October in Durban, South Africa. <em>To be continued.</em></p>
