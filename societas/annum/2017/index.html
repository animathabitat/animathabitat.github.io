        <p class="lineend">ANIMAT HABITAT&mdash;A half-step forward at <a href="../../../" title="Animat Habitat">Animat Habitat</a> in 2017. The official website was further developed to feature a member area, a gift shop and so on. Research for the first project at the studio resurfaced and presented an opportunity to collaborate on a similar story about the conservation of elephants and so on. And the studio received its first contributions and donations and so on. The studio has maintained its operating cost through the financial year end of 2017 at ~CA$36,000 (three per cent over the previous year). ~CA$2,275 was received as a contribution to operating costs (15 per cent to computer art hardware and software, 85 per cent to support studio investments in general in future). Studio expenses were limited to ~CA$1,000 in the 2017 financial year. These are managed in four categories: hardware, software, fees and development.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Art Hardware: CA$175;</li>
          <li>Computer Art Software: CA$509;</li>
          <li>Expenses and Fees: CA$20;</li>
          <li>Research and Development: CA$369;</li>
          <li>Sum Total Investment (2017): CA$1,073.</li></ul>

        <p class="linebreak">A notable expense at the studio this year was a pair of computer art software licenses: Serif Affinity Designer and Serif Affinity Photo. These software tools were released and well-received first on Apple platforms. These licences were acquired at the studio upon the release of both the vector and the photo editing software on Microsoft Windows. This is just one example of a considered and continued shift away from subscription services.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">CORPORATE WEBSITE&mdash;Members of the organization have been granted access to corporate documents in a protected area of the Animat Habitat website. This member handbook is a Web archive of Animat Habitat articles, by-laws, letters, minutes, registers and so on. &#47;<a href="../../../societas/" title="Animat Habitat societ&amacr;s.">societ&amacr;s</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">The official website has also been extended to include the WooCommerce information architecture: a gift shop featuring the art of studio projects and so on. This may in future create alternate revenue channels for wildlife conservation. Another section of the official website has been allocated as an archive of research on conservation, with access to information on the state of preserving and protecting wild places around the world. After all, an objective of art in support wildlife conservation is practical only if there is wilderness left to conserve. The hope, here, is to raise awareness and contribution for select foundations and funds with constructive wildlife conservation projects around the world. The first publication has a focus on wildlife conservation in southern and eastern Africa. &#47;<a href="../../../conservation/" title="Animat Habitat conservation.">Conservation</a></p>

        <p class="letterhead">SCENE ONE&mdash;Ella the elephant was re-introduced in a classic turntable render that hearkens to her origin in 2010 in an animated short for a computer animation program at Carleton University. This render represents a milestone for the computer-generated character and the project as a whole. &#47;scene&#47;one&#47;<a href="../../../scene/one/making-of-ella-4/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un. Making of Ella, 4.">elephant</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">Promotional material and editorial from the studio has otherwise been deferred to a time when the visual effects and the interactive elements for <a href="../../../scene/one/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un."><i>White Elephant</i></a> are advanced to a point where the studio has the capacity for a public relations campaign in the lead up to a first publication. This project is intended as a showpiece for the capacity of interactive wildlife art to impart responsibility for a disappearing world. This art is made to inspire support for wildlife conservation, as well as to attract opportunities for the studio to partner with conservationists and storytellers in the wild. Already, an opportunity to collaborate on another project about elephants has been pressed upon the studio schedule, and the first publication at Animat Habitat has been pushed a minimum estimate of six-months: to fall of 2020.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">OTHER PROJECTS&mdash;This other project about elephants is a documentary film by James Currie, titled <a href="../../../url/git/bigtuskers/" rel="noopener" title="Last of the Big Tuskers (documentary film, 2018)"><i>Last of the Big Tuskers</i></a>. This documentary looks at the role of dominant bull elephants in elephant social structures. For a film about elephants, the focus is uniquely not on the matriarchal herds. This history of elephant conservation is instead presented in the context of the other elephant groups: askari bachelor herds.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">These elephant bulls, called askaris, follow in the footsteps of a patriarch&mdash;a biggest bull elephant &ndash; likely with the biggest tusks &ndash; in the area. The increasingly few elephants with tusks estimated in excess of one-hundred pounds per tusk are known as <i>super-tuskers</i>. This film explains that the tusks of bull elephants grow at an accelerated rate when the bull is coming of age. When an elephant with the genetic makeup for big tusks has just reached the physical maturity of a <i>super-tusker</i>, that elephant becomes a prime target for poaching at the same time as that same elephant has just reached prime age for breeding. The film looks to tourism as a solution: managing the revenue from tourism to support the national parks as well as the communities who continue to coexist on the front lines of a conflict with elephants. The same elephants that people all over the world &ndash; everyone, everywhere &ndash; so clearly uphold in story and in art.</p>
