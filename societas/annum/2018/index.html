        <p class="lineend">ANIMAT HABITAT&mdash;A step to the side at <a href="../../../" title="Animat Habitat">Animat Habitat</a> in 2018. The official website was further developed as a WordPress child theme and was further secured for member interaction and registration and so on. A collaboration on a similar story about the conservation of elephants has shared great lessons and great losses and so on. And the studio managed its first donations. The studio has maintained its operating cost through the financial year end of 2018 at ~CA$37,500 (three per cent over the previous year). ~CA$2,385 was received as a contribution to studio efforts and more than CA$1,000 of that contribution was directed to wildlife conservation projects on the ground (33 per cent to Computer Art Hardware and Software, 25 per cent to support studio investments in general in future, ~25 per cent to Big Life Foundation, ~15 per cent to Sheldrick Wildlife Trust). The studio expenses were limited to ~CA$1,000 in the 2018 financial year. These expenses are managed in four categories: hardware, software, fees and development.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Art Hardware: CA$742;</li>
          <li>Computer Art Software: CA$31;</li>
          <li>Expenses and Fees: CA$137;</li>
          <li>Research and Development: CA$387;</li>
          <li>Sum Total Investment (2018): CA$1,297.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="linebreak">A notable expense at the studio this year was a modest resupply of Hard Felt Nibs for the Wacom Art Pen. Art has traditionally been a tangible work. Digital art has opened a world of possibilities, however, the tools for digital artists are limited in many ways. Wacom, a Japanese computer art technology company named from the Japanese <i>wa</i>, &ldquo;harmony&rdquo;, and the abbreviated <i>com</i>, &ldquo;computer&rdquo;, has made creating digital art feel most connected to the physical process. Intuos Pro is the current iteration of tablet technology, <i>sans</i> screen, and the Hard Felt Nibs are a supply of replaceable tips for the pen that make drawing on the surface of the tablet with Wacom Art Pen feel more like drawing on paper. Wacom Intuos Pro &ndash; also Intuos 4 &ndash; with the Art Pen and with Hard Felt Nibs is the cornerstone of the computer art toolkit at Animat Habitat.</p>

        <p class="linebreak lineend">Notable studio expenses are listed below.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">CORPORATE WEBSITE&mdash;Designing a website and gift shop is one milestone, then developing and maintaining the website to effectively manage updates is another. The studio has rebuilt the WordPress and WooCommerce architecture into a structured and versioned child of the WordPress theme: <i>Twenty Thirteen</i>, by the WordPress team. The child theme designed for the studio website is titled <i>Twenty Thirteen Unicorn</i> (Dark, Light, Rainbow). The <i>Twenty Thirteen</i> architecture continues to underlie the <i>Unicorn</i> theme and continues to be maintained and so on.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">This design process was replicated for a second WordPress theme, this time based on the development of the official website for a documentary film by James Currie, titled: <a href="../../../url/git/bigtuskers/" title="Last of the Big Tuskers (documentary film, 2018)"><i>Last of the Big Tuskers</i></a> (2018). The website architecture has a similar structure, however, this website design prominently features a cover artwork. This time the child theme is derived from the WordPress theme <i>Twenty Seventeen</i>, also by the WordPress team. The child theme designed for this documentary film is titled <i>Twenty Seventeen Coffee</i> (Dark, Light, Blend). The <i>Twenty Seventeen</i> architecture continues to underlie the <i>Coffee</i> theme and continues to be maintained and so on.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">CONSERVATION&mdash;<a href="../../../url/-org/biglife/" title="Big Life Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Life Foundation</a> and <a href="../../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust/" title="SWT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a> (SWT) were identified as two official channels to receive revenue from the art of <i>scene one</i> at Animat Habitat. Big Life Foundation in particular is a force in the protection and preservation of wildlife and wild places in Kenya and Tanzania. An initial donation was made through Nick Brandt and Big Life USA. SWT is another pioneering force for wildlife, and operates in sites across Kenya. An initial donation was directed to a SWT nursery unit in Nairobi National Park. At least one wildlife conservation project on the ground in Namibia or in Botswana is to be identified next as a third official channel to receive revenue from the art of <i>scene one</i>. (To be determined.) One or two more projects on the ground in Africa may be considered after that.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Joined as a signatory <i>Elephant Professional</i> to <u>The Elephant Charter</u>, an authored set of guiding principles by Joyce Poole, Cynthia Moss, Raman Sukumar, Andrea Turkalo and Katy Payneand, based on elephant biology, to form a touchstone for anyone needing to address elephant interests. Also signed on to the <u>World Wide Fund for Nature</u> Pledge for Our Planet: to reduce the carbon footprint of the studio, to be a voice for the planet, and to address political representatives to help create and support policies that recognize and respect the importance of nature. These principles and petitions represent values that are shared at the studio. &#47;scene&#47;one&#47;<a href="../../../scene/one/history-of-elephants-charter/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un.

        <p class="letterhead">OTHER PROJECTS&mdash;<i>Last of the Big Tuskers</i> has entered festivals in 2018. The studio was honored to contribute graphic art and visual effects art to this documentary film in support of wildlife conservation in particular in Tembe Elephant Park. This collaboration has involved map sequences that help set context for location in the film, as well as cover art and title design that help set a visual tone for the film. This visual tone was extended to the design of the website, which serves as a public archive about the film.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The map graphics were visual effects based on satellite image data and a model of geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems. <i>Last of the Big Tuskers</i> (2018) was the first ultra high-definition (UHD) production at the studio. The visual effects were rendered, composited and encoded in-house in a total compute time of three weeks, two days, twenty-one hours. Time to set up the models, renders, simulations and so on &ndash; time of production was ten weeks spread out in stages from spring 2017 to spring 2018.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The map graphics are pictured for ninety-seven seconds (2,425 frames at 25 frames per second).</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The one minute and thirty-seven seconds was made up of six shorter sequences of satellite-like imagery, each with select indications of international borders and national parks. Each frame was simulated then rendered in fifteen to thirty minutes with relation to the size of the indicated areas on screen. The renders were composited as layered uncompressed 32-bit color-depth image sequences, and encoded as Rec.709 DNxHR 4.4.4 compressed videos to integrate with the Avid editing system. <i>Last of the Big Tuskers</i> (2018) was also the first production for the AVID Editing environment at the studio, and transferring the composited sequences from Adobe Creative Suite involved an appreciation of image formats, compression algorithms and video codecs and so on. All this data required a minimum drive space: 1.64Tb, with an associated production cost of archival storage and studio workstation hardware and so on.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The title design featured a title typeface designed by Anton Scholtz, a typographer who &ldquo;specializes in African flavor fonts [with his] foundry based in Durban, South Africa.&rdquo; The typeface: <a href="../../../url/myfonts/sholtz-tabwa/" title="Scholtz Fonts / Tabwa Regular" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tabwa</a> and title design applied in the film was appropriated to the cover artwork and the website and so on. The cover art was painted in Adobe Photoshop in a painterly style that was reproduced in a set of magnificent seven elephants featured in the film. The digital artwork was a collaboration based upon a frame of footage, or still image, that was referenced directly from the film. The art was made as a graphic version of the archival imagery of the last of the big tuskers. ~&#47;art-of-<a href="../../../url/git/danealeksander-art-of-last-of-the-big-tuskers/" title="Dane Aleksander / Art of Last of the Big Tuskers" target="_blank">last-of-the-big-tuskers</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">A word about Tembe Elephant Park, South Africa. Tembe has a unique topography&mdash;a special sandforest that shares a border with Mozambique and that has an elephant population with very special characteristics: &ldquo;a special genetic makeup to produce strong tuskers&rdquo;, according to Alois Haberhauer, Elephant Geneticist: University of Kriel.</p>

        <div>
          <p><b class="color">&ldquo;</b>From a genetics standpoint [the elephants in Tembe] are quite gifted, [though this has a lot to do] with the history of the area, that this must have been a very difficult area to hunt in the peak of the ivory trade, so that would have left a lot of these bulls alone[.] [The elephants in Tembe] were not hunted back then for their ivory. [The result is that there are] a lot more tuskers [per population size in Tembe] than anywhere in South Africa. Even [compared] to a place like Tsavo [National Park], which is a massive park with lots of elephants, they only have a handful of tuskers [per population size.] That is something quite special for Tembe.<b class="color">&rdquo;</b><font class="color"> &mdash;&nbsp;Leonard Muller, Elephant Monitor at Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife.</font> ~&#47;<a href="../../../url/git/bigtuskers-tembe-tusker-foundation/" title="Last of the Big Tuskers / Tembe Tusker Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tembe-tusker-foundation</a></p>
