        <p class="lineend">OAFA&mdash;<em>A strange storm.</em> This year the world looks a little different. A pandemic has revealed new perspectives. Some political and racial justice movements have gained traction in a new way. This annual address will conclude with some words on the matter. For now, thanks for your interest in studio operations. The work continues. The expenses are managed in four categories: hardware, software, fees and development.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Art Hardware: CA$194;</li>
          <li>Computer Art Software: null;</li>
          <li>Expenses and Fees: CA$1,774;</li>
          <li>Research and Development: CA$283;</li>
          <li>Total Investment (Year): CA$2,250.</li></ul>

        <p class="linebreak">A notable expense at the studio this year was oil paint supplies, specifically Gamblin Artist Oil Colors and Apollon Birch Wood Panels. Gamblin &ndash; founded in 1980 by Robert Gamblin &ndash; is a relatively modern colormaking company, based in Portland, Oregon. The company shares a clear appreciation for the history of color in oil painting as well as takes a contemporary approach to colormaking so as to fit the needs of the modern-day oil painter. This balance of classic colors with a modern palette in many ways reflects a conservationist as well as computer art direction at Animat Habitat. Apollon on the other hand &ndash; founded first as a picture framing store in the 1960s by Dimitri Apokatanidis &ndash; is an artist canvas manufacturing company, based in Montreal, Quebec. The panels are made in Canada, made of three millimetre Russian birch wood, and make up the foundation for three studio projects. First a triptych, titled: &ldquo;The beginning of painting.&rdquo; Also a wood panel alternative for scene two: <em>White Tiger</em>. And a collage of panels for a study behind the scenes of scene three, titled: &ldquo;The right of way.&rdquo;</p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA WEBSITE&mdash;In the final year of a web hosting agreement, the opportunity was taken to transfer the official website of the organization and affiliate websites hosted by Dane Aleksander from a web server in the United States to a web server in Canada powered by one-hundred per cent renewable energy. The official website of the organization was also minified and archived on GitHub, and continues to be cached with Cloudfare to improve access around the world. &#47;&#47;<a href="../../url/.ca/whc-green-hosting/" title="WHC / Green Web Hosting in Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whc.ca/green-hosting</a></p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA CONSERVATION&mdash;<a href="../../url/-org/elephantswithoutborders/" title="Elephants Without Borders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elephants Without Borders</a> (EWB) was identified as a third official channel to receive revenue from the art of <em>scene one</em> at Animat Habitat. The studio has recognized the contribution of EWB to elephant conservation in Africa along with previously recognized <a href="../../url/-org/biglife/" title="Big Life Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Life Foundation</a> and <a href="../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust/" title="SWT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a>. Elephants Without Borders was co-founded in 2007 by Michael Chase and Kelly Landen with a focus on the scientific survey of elephant populations. EWB is based in Botswana, and has operations that extend across the northern border to the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. EWB aerial surveys have also extended across Africa to establish a census of the entire savanna elephant population. EWB has faced recent political strife as the future of elephants in Botswana has been complicated by an unexpected political shift in 2018, and in the face of a pro-hunting lobby fueled by the growing human populations that incur increased human-elephants conflicts in the area. &#47;scene&#47;one&#47;<a href="../../scene/one/elephant-conservation-botswana/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un.

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA SCENE TWO&mdash;Let the wild painting start! This year has marked the beginning of oil painting at the studio, with a number of canvases primed in the build up to an exhibition of work following the digital release of scene one: <em>White Elephant</em>. This first publication is currently scheduled for December 2022. The first studio art exhibition will follow thereafter and will feature paintings and prints, some for sale and some for show, altogether designed to exhibit the work behind the scenes of scene one, two and three and so on. The exhibition will showcase scene two: <em>White Tiger</em>&mdash;an oil painting of a tiger in the taiga. The painting will be presented for auction in support of boreal forest conservation. Another painting, titled: &ldquo;Right of Way&rdquo;, a study behind the scenes of scene three will also be presented for auction and in this case in support of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. There is more to be announced. This is just the beginning. &#47;scene&#47;two&#47;<a href="../../scene/two/the-beginning-of-painting/" title="Animat Habitat scene two. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne deux.

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA IN THE WORLD&mdash;In a global pandemic, in the political noise, the studio seldom speaks. Suffice to say, we recognize science. And we recognize a racial justice movement in America. We listen. We vote. We see the climate changing. We see how extreme weather, air pollution and industrial waste continues to affect areas disproportionately. We see where Inuit, First Nations and M&eacute;tis continue to struggle for access to clean water, healthy food, health care, equal education and equal opportunity in Canada. Indigenous lives matter. Black lives matter. Racialized lives matter and so on. <a href="../../url/-ca/elections/" title="Elections Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register to vote.</a> (Canada)</p>
