        <p class="lineend">OAFA&mdash;<em>In the wake of a strange storm.</em> The world is waking to climate challenges. The natural world is taking on ever more pressure, and the story of wildlife conservation enters a chapter without eco-tourism. The wilderness does not speak a word. The work continues at Animat Habitat. The studio has renewed support for a number of wild places. The expenses are managed in four categories: hardware, software, fees and development.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA SCENE ONE&mdash;The first studio project marches on with creative lock on the design of the comic book: the panel layout, the in-app interaction and the audio architecture and so on. Final panel art continues to pend final animation. The project still has a way to go, yet December 2022 is not far away. <em>We journey on.</em></p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA CONSERVATION&mdash;<a href="../../url/-ca/wwf/" title="World Wildlife Fund / Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Wildlife Fund</a> (WWF) in Canada was identified as an official channel for revenue from the art of scenes two and three at Animat Habitat. The work of WWF to protect nature has elevated the identity of the organization to an international stage. The chapter of WWF in Canada has progressive leadership on environmental policy with Megan Leslie, and has held as a priority the conservation of coniferous forest habitat as well as arctic archipelago habitat. The studio has managed this channel to support the conservation of boreal forest in Canada as well as polar bear dens.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">The studio has continued to follow the work of Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (SWT)&mdash;this year marked the graduation of Kiasa from her nursery herd in Nairobi to a reintegration unit in Tsavo East National Park. This year, SWT also commemorated two elephants who were part of the same nursery herd and who were lost along their journey back to the wild. The lionhearted Luggard had spent time with Kiasa at the nursery before being translocated to a reintegration unit in Umani Springs. There, despite his injured leg, Luggard was able to experience a semblance of a wild existence before he passed away. Kiasa and two age-mates, Kiombo and Maktao, were translocated to the same reintegration unit shortly after the passing of Luggard. Kiasa, Kiombo and Maktao are now thriving in Umani Springs. Two more age-mates, Maisha and Nabulu, were subsequently translocated to a second reintegration unit in Ithumba. Shortly thereafter, Maisha quite mysteriously and suddenly passed away. The loving labour of hand-raising elephant orphans carries on as the late Dame Daphne Sheldrick once described, &ldquo;tempered with a good dose of tears.&rdquo; More on this story at <a href="../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust" target="_blank" title="SWT">sheldrickwildlifetrust.org</a>. ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust-unexpected-loss-of-maisha/" target="_blank" title="SWT / News / Updates / Unexpected Loss of Maisha">maisha</a> ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust-orphans-kiasa/" target="_blank" title="SWT / Orphans / Kiasa">kiasa</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">The studio has continued to follow the photography of Nick Brandt&mdash;<em>This Empty World</em> (photography book, 2019) further explores the intersection of humans and wild animals. The book further raises awareness for the work of Big Life Foundation. This year, the studio has supported Big Life Foundation as they pressed against agricultural development in Kenya in the critical Kimana corridor for the greater Amboseli ecosystem.

        <p class="linebreak">The studio has signed on to a number of petitions. We registered with <a href="../../url/-earth/stopecocide/">Stop Ecocide</a> in support of the legal and practical assistance required to create the one law with the power to protect the future of life on earth. We registered with <a href="../../url/-org/environmentamerica/"-->Environment America</a> to protect the boreal forest from deforestation. We echo the statement of public lands campaign director Ellen Montgomery, &ldquo;The boreal forest is home to billions of birds and endangered caribou and the idea that it is being logged at all, much less unsustainably, is tragic.&rdquo; And, we registered with First People of Southern Africa (SAN) to protect the Okavango Delta watershed from crude oil drilling. This petition closed with 3,389 supporters. The undersigned supporters of SAN strongly oppose plans to prospect for, and potentially extract, oil and gas in the Kavango basin. &#47;scene&#47;one&#47;<a href="../../scene/one/elephant-conservation-kavango/" title="Animat Habitat scene one. &ndash;&nbsp;sc&egrave;ne un.
