        <h5>Kjipuktuk &ndash; Halifax, NS Canada</h5>
        <h5>Preceded by: <a href="../2021/" title="OAFA Annual Address">Annual Address</a>, <em>2021.9.01</em></h5>

        <p>OAFA&mdash;<em>Dreams of democracy in Ukraine, and drought and food insecurity in the horn of Africa.</em> In East Africa, the rains have largely failed for another season for a fourth year in row. The Kenyan landscape has become overgrazed by livestock. Any agriculture there has become a beacon for elephants. People and wildlife have come in conflict over what natural resources remain. The drought in East Africa has been &ndash; and continues to be &ndash; devastating. Add to that, this part of the world has relied on the import of grain from Ukraine and the export has largely failed for a season as well. There is at least another month until the rains arrive, and then again their arrival has become less assured. For people and wildlife in East Africa &ndash; and for all those who dare to dream in Ukraine &ndash; each passing day is a struggle for survival.</p>

          <!-- Here in Canada, we share a dream with Ukraine. Here at the studio, we want peace for tigers, too. -->

        <p class="linebreak lineend">In this financial year, we have managed to direct more funds in support of wildlife conservation projects than was invested in studio projects. This was the first year we managed a net contribution albeit a bit of an early outlier at a relatively small scale. The expenses are managed in four categories: hardware, software, fees and development.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Art Hardware: CA$90;</li>
          <li>Computer Art Software: null;</li>
          <li>Expenses and Fees: CA$76;</li>
          <li>Research and Development: CA$353;</li>
          <li>Total Investment (Year): CA$492.</li></ul>

        <p class="linebreak">A notable expense at the studio this year was another resupply of Hard Felt Nibs, this time for the Wacom&reg; Pro Pen. Wacom&reg; Intuos Pro with the Pro Pen &ndash; also the Art Pen &ndash; and with Hard Felt Nibs continues to be the cornerstone of the computer art toolkit at Animat Habitat. Another expense of note was an allocation of funds for a future exhibition of work with pending costs for gala prints and gala space and so on.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Allocation">1</a>]</sup></p>

        <p class="linebreak lineend">Notable studio expenses are listed below.</p>

        <h5>Computer Art Hardware [of 2 items]:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Wacom&reg; 10PK Hard Felt Nibs (4x): CA$64 <em>2022</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="linebreak">Expenses and Fees [of 2 items]:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Thera-Band exercise ball: CA$64 <em>2022</em></li></ul>

        <h5 class="linebreak">Research and Development [of 7 items]:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Nick Brandt, <em>The Day May Break</em> (2021): CA$175 <em>2021</em></li>

        </ul>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA WEBSITE&mdash;The official website of Animat Habitat was incremented and maintained. The code was developed to take advantage of the latest features for Google Fonts as well as to optimize for Google search engine with improved page load time and secured page content and so on. The theme was developed to define CSS custom properties for dynamic language selection. The Member Handbook was moved to a secure server. The website version was incremented to 2.0 on GitHub, and the version history was reset.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA SCENE ONE&mdash;The first publication at Animat Habitat has been moved to fall of 2024. The exhibition of work scheduled thereafter has been rescheduled for winter 2024 or spring 2025.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA SCENE TWO&mdash;The beginning of painting has coincided with &lsquo;<em>the end of oysters and gender freedom.</em>&rsquo; The second publication at Animat Habitat&mdash;an oil painting of a tiger in the taiga has held a natural connection to the Siberian wilderness. Our study of these wild tigers and of the conservation of their taiga habitat has continued, however, the studio has resolved to direct all proceeds from scene two instead into the conservation of boreal forest habitat in Canada.</p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA CONSERVATION CHAMPION&mdash;<em>Poaching has continued to threaten elephants and rhinos and other wildlife across the African continent. At the worst of times, this threat has come in the form of organized crime syndicates. At other times, poaching has posed as a bogeyman in the shadow of the human expanse that has continued to develop into the last vestiges of wilderness. Once these wild places become developed or disconnected, there is a permanence of loss.</em> This year we have taken a moment to celebrate giraffes. Giraffes are a symbol of Africa, and like African elephants, these gentle giants are a keystone species for ecosystems across the continent.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">First, we joined fifty-thousand advocates in an <u>African Wildlife Foundation</u> (AWF) petition to stand tall for giraffes in Kenya in the plight against habitat loss and human expanse, poaching, and now intense drought. AWF has partnered with local authorities to manage land use and respond to threats, to research and monitor giraffe populations, and to raise awareness for giraffe conservation.</p>

        <p class="linebreak">Then on World Giraffe Day, the studio held a screening of the 2018 documentary film about Anne Innis Dagg, <em>The Woman Who Loves Giraffes</em>. Dr Anne Innis Dagg was recognized as a principle champion at Animat Habitat for her legacy of giraffe research along with her foundation: <a href="../../url/-org/anneinnisdaggfoundation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Anne Innis Dagg Foundation">Anne Innis Dagg Foundation</a>. Her early studies have informed most giraffe conservationists in the field today. Animat Habitat has likewise recognized Monica Bond and Derek Lee and their team at <a href="../../url/-org/wildnatureinstitute/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wild Nature Institute">Wild Nature Institute</a> who have continued to research giraffes and to raise awareness about &lsquo;the silent extinction.&rsquo; ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-com/thewomanwholovedgiraffes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Anne Innis Dagg / The Woman Who Loved Giraffes (documentary film, 2018)">the-woman-who-loves-giraffes</a></p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA CONSERVATION&mdash;<em>People everywhere can act on climate to lessen the impacts of these droughts.</em> As a not-for-profit organization in Canada, we see an obligation to address our impact on the global climate. This means investing in sustainable practices at the studio. This means urging our elected officials to act now to minimize the impact that Canada has on future loss and damage around the world. This means restoring carbon-rich ecosystems to help reverse the biodiversity loss that has escalated here, and everywhere. Boreal forests and boreal peatlands, to name two examples in Canada, actively sequester carbon from the atmosphere and naturally regenerate important wild places. Canada must advance Indigenous knowledge and leadership as a means of becoming a proud steward and protector of its natural habitats. The studio has continued to align with the leadership at <u>World Wildlife Fund</u> (WWF) Canada, with a plan to <em>Regenerate Canada</em>. And we added our <em>Voice for the Planet</em> at WWF. ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-ca/wwf-regenerate-canada/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="World Wildlife Fund / Canada / Regenerate Canada">regenerate-canada</a> ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-org/worldwildlife-voice/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="World Wildlife Fund / Voice for the Planet">voice-for-the-planet</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">We have supported the Jane Goodall Act in Canada. The bill was first introduced in late 2020, then was delayed due to an election. In March of this year, Dr Jane Goodall and the former Canadian Senator Murray Sinclair reintroducted this landmark piece of legislation to ban the import of elephant ivory and hunting trophies and to phase out captivity of elephants, apes and bears and so on. ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-ca/janegoodall-the-jane-goodall-act/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Jane Goodall / Canada / The Jane Goodall Act">the-jane-goodall-act</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak"><a href="../../url/-org/nationalgeographic-okavango/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="National Geographic / Okavango Wilderness Project">National Geographic Okavango Wilderness Project</a> (NGOWP) was identified as a fourth official channel to receive revenue from the art of <em>scene one</em> at Animat Habitat. The studio has recognized the effort to research and to protect the Okavango watershed, which was featured in the National Geographic documentary film <em>Into the Okavango</em> (2018) and in the Wild Bird Trust podcast mini-series <em>Guardians of the River</em> (2021). The Okavango Wilderness Project has been led by National Geographic explorer Steve Boyes, program director Kerlen Costa, along with many mokoro pollers and wildlife researchers along the many river crossings from Angola, through Namibia, onto Botswana. The early expeditions &ndash; and the stories about them &dash; have raised the profile of NGOWP to one of the top-most funded in the 150 year history at National Geographic Society. The later expiditions have taken the opportunity to document and to uphold the traditions of tribal livelihoods as part of a holistic approach to protect this place. Animat Habitat has managed a channel in support of the Okavango Wilderness Project to help conserve this vast, vital watershed for elephants and everyone. ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-com/nationalgeographic-into-the-okavango/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="National Geographic / Into the Okavango (documentary film, 2018)">into-the-okavango</a> ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-com/wildbirdtrust-guardians-of-the-river/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wild Bird Trust / Guardians of the River (podcast, 2021)">guardians-of-the-river</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">We have continued to support <u>Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</u> (SWT) and to follow the journey of the nursery herds back into the wild. Kiasa, the sassy little tail-bitter, has reached five years of age by now and has graduated to the Umani reintegration unit. The studio has celebrated this graduation with the symbolic adoption of a second elephant&mdash;an orphan of the dry season of 2021 and a victim of a snare, Latika. Latika has turned two years of age by now and has just started her journey at the nursery unit in Nairobi. ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sheldrick Wildlife Trust">sheldrickewildlifetrust.org</a> ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust-orphans-kiasa/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sheldrick Wildlife Trust / Orphans / Kiasa">kiasa</a> ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-org/sheldrickwildlifetrust-orphans-latika/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sheldrick Wildlife Trust / Orphans / Latika">latika</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">We have continued to follow the work of Nick Brandt, who has taken his photography out of Amboseli in his latest book: <em>The Day May Break</em> (2021). We continue to support the work of <u>Big Life Foundation</u> in Amboseli, now as part of the Ranger Club. These recurring contributions are part of a commitment to long term sustainable support for these projects. ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-com/nickbrandt-the-day-may-break/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Nick Brandt / The Day May Break (book, 2021)">the-day-may-break</a> ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-org/biglife/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Big Life Foundation">biglife.org</a></p>

        <p class="linebreak">We have made an initial donation to elephant research at Elephants Without Borders (EWB) in Botswana. We opened a dialogue with EWB, and we hope to ensure long-term support for these channels for the conservation of elephants and giraffes and so on. ~&#47;<a href="../../url/-org/elephantswithoutborders/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Elephants Without Borders">elephantswithoutborders.org</a></p>

        <p class="letterhead">OAFA AWARD&mdash;The Periwinkle Blue annual nature documentary film and series review process was officially integrated into an arts council at Animat Habitat. The Periwinkle Blue catalog of awards and nominees for nature documentary was published with relation to the years since the foundation of the studio. The reason for formalizing this review process is to shine a light on the wildlife cinematographers and film studios that have informed much of our artwork and our perspective on the wild places and the animals that live in them. The Periwinkle Blue annual nature documentary award for best nature documentary film or series or mini-series for 2021 was awarded to the BBC Natural History Unit mini-series <em>A Perfect Planet</em>, produced by Huw Cordey with <u>Silverback Films</u>. ~&#47;<a href="../../url/git/periwinkle-award/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Periwinkle Blue / AND Award">periwinkle-blue</a> ~&#47;<a href="../../url/www/silverbackfilms-a-perfect-planet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Silverback Films / A Perfect Planet (BBC mini-series, 2021)">a-perfect-planet</a></p>
